##04 are nested rules in SASS?

Repeating the same selectors over and over again,
you can write one style rules inside another.
Sass will automatically combine the outer rule’s selector with the inner rule’s.

Nesting is combining of different logic structures.
Using SASS, we can combine multiple CSS rules within one another.
If you are using multiple selectors, then you can use one selector inside another to create compound selectors
