1) What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a scripting language. It is different from Java language. It is object-based, lightweight, cross-platform
translated language.
It is widely used for client-side validation.
The JavaScript is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser


2) What is anonymous Function in javascript.

Anonymous Function is a function that does not have any name. it can only be accessed by a variable it is stored in as a
function as a value.
An anonymous function can also have multiple arguments, but only one expression.

3) what is templelet literal :-Template literals allow variables in strings: `sanket${19}`

4) what is the js variable

  In JavaScript,
a variable stores the data value that can be changed later on.
There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:

var
let
const

var
Function-scoped or globally-scoped
Accidental global variables
reassignable and redeclarable

let
Block scoped
Temporal dead zone
Reassignable, not redeclarable

const
Block scoped
Temporal dead zone
Not reassignable, not redeclarable/

5) what is the js operator

An operator performs some operation on single or multiple operands (data value) and produces a result.
JavaScript includes following categories of operators.

Arithmetic Operators * - + --- Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations between numeric
operands.
Comparison Operators > < !=--- javaScript provides comparison operators that compare two operands and return a boolean
    value true or false. Logical Operators && ! || ( or ) --- the logical operators are used to combine two or more
    conditions Assignment Operators --- JavaScript provides the assignment operators to assign values to
    variables=+=-=Conditional Operators if else, switch Ternary Operator 6)What are Events in JavaScript? Javascript has
    events that provide a dynamic interface to a webpage. These events are connected to elements in the Document Object
    Model(DOM). 7)What are Events in JavaScript...? Types of Events in JavaScript Onclick Event Onkeyup Event
    Onmouseover Event Onload Event Onfocus Event Onmouseover OnBlur Event 8) what is the data type There are 2 kinds of
    data types, each of which are further divided into sub-types. Primitive data types : Data types which are
    pre-defined and supported by the programming language. -- String, Number,boolen, Undefind ,Value Non-primitive data
    types : Data types which are created by the user and not pre-defined by the language itself. -- Array, Object 1.
    Number: Number type stands for both integers and floating points. Many mathematical operations are carried out using
    these numbers. 2. String: Strings are used to store data that involves characters, like names or addresses. You can
    perform operations like string concatenation, in JavaScript. 3. Boolean: Boolean type only has 2 types of return
    values, true and false. This type is usually used to check if something is correct or incorrec 4. Null value: A null
    value is used to declare a variable as empty, or as a variable with an unknown value. 5 Undefined value: An
    undefined value is very similar to null value as it also makes a type of its own. The meaning of undefined is “value
    is not assigned”. 9) What is The String -s The String is represent a sequence of characters.Strings are useful for
    holding data that can be represented in text form. 10) Js String methods Some of the important javascript string
    functions include: charAt(x) This function will return the character at the x position within the string.
    charCodeAt(x) This function will return the unicode value of the character at position ‘x’ within the string.
    concat(v1,v2..) This function will return the unicode value of the character at position ‘x’ within the string.
    fromCharcode(c1,c2) Function will return a string created by using specified sequence of unicode values(argc1,c2
    indexOf(substr, [start]) indexOf() is a string method that is used to find the location of a substring in a string
    lastIndexOf(substr, [start]) The JavaScript string lastIndexOf() method retrieves the position of a char value
    present in the given string from last position. JavaScript ----------------------- replace(regexp/substr,
    replacetext) search(regexp) slice(start, [end]) This function returns a substring of the string based on the “start”
    and “end” index arguments split(delimiter, [limit]) the split() method divides a String into an ordered list of
    substrings, puts these substrings into an array, and returns the array. substr(start, [length]) substring(from,
    [to]) toLowerCase() This will return the string with all of its characters converted to lowercase toUpperCase() This
    will return the string with all of its characters converted to uppercase includes() It is used to check whether a
    string contains the specified string or characters. endsWith() repeat() valueOf() trim() This function removes
    whitespace from both ends of a string. 11) array is a single variable used to store different elements. and access
    them by a single variable. 1. Using an array literal const array1=["eat", "sleep" ]; 2. Using the new keyword const
    array2=new Array("eat", "sleep" ); 12) ARRAY methods Array.isArray()==Determine if a value is an array.
    push()==Insert an element at the end of the array.=> arr.push("dog")
    includes() == check value present or not [1,2,3,4,5].includes(2) // True;
    pop() == Remove an element from the end of the array.=> arr.pop();
    shift()== Remove a first element from an array => arr.shift();
    unshift()== method adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array => arr.unshift("dog");
    slice(start,end) == Create a shallow copy of an array.=> [1,2,3,4].slice( 1, 2) op:[2,3]
    length== Determine the size of an array => arr.length()
    at()== method would help you access the elements of an array =>arr.at(index)
    concat()==used to merge two or more arrays =>arr3= arr1.concat(arr2)
    find()== method returns the value of the first element in array that satisfies the provided testing function.
    reverse()== method reverses an array in place. array1.reverse()
    every()==method checks all the given elements in an array are satisfying the provided condition
    =>[1,2,3].every(()=>val> 2); op:true
    join(")== method creates and returns a new string arr.join(-)
    indexOf()== It returns the index of the first occurrence of an element in the array. If an element is not found, the
    indexOf() method returns -1.

    splice(index,delete, add) == The splice() method helps you add, update, and remove elements in an array.
    const names = ['t', 'a', 'b'].splice(1, 0, 'k'); // ['t',"k", 'a', 'b']

    filter()== The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided
    function.**
    numbers.filter(value => value >= 0)

    flat()== method creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified
    depth.**
    arr = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6, [7, 8, [9, 10]]]]];
    arr.flat(Infinity);
    // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    reduce()== method reduces the array to a single value from left to right.This method leaves the original array
    unchanged.
    var arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    var val = arr.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr);
    console.log(val)

    map()== method calls the specified function for every array element and returns the new array.
    This method doesn't change the original array.
    var arr=[2,4,6];
    var result=arr.map(x=>x*3);

    The some() methods checks if atleast a single array element passes the test, implemented by the provided function.
    If the test is passed, it returns true. Else, returns false. array.some(even) // true

    The sort() array method
    The default sort() method converts the element types into strings and then sorts them.
    The default sorting order is ascending. The sort() method changes the original array.
    const numbers = [23, 5, 100, 56, 9, 13, 37, 10, 1]
    function ascendingComp(a, b){
    return (a-b);
    }
    numbers.sort(ascendingComp);

    forEach() ==method executes a provided function once for each array element.
    const a = ["a", "b", "c"];
    a.forEach((entry) => {
    console.log(entry);
    });

    -** Difference between the for each and map ***
    const myAwesomeArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    myAwesomeArray.forEach(x => x * x)
    //>>>>>>>>>>>>>return value: undefined
    myAwesomeArray.map(x => x * x)
    //>>>>>>>>>>>>>return value: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

    13)What is the JavaScript object
    An object is a collection of data and functionality

    Each key-value pair is called a property.
    The key of a property can be a string and the value of a property can be any valid JavaScript value e.g., a string,
    a number, an array, and even a function.
    When a function is a property ofan object, its often called a method.

    14)what is the object method=>

    JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.
    A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition .

    15)what is the object property
    Each key-value pair is called a property.
    Properties are the values assoyciated with a JavaScript object.

    16)Optional chaining (?.) The optional chaining ?. is a safe way to access nested object properties, even if an
    intermediate property doesnt exist.
    const adventurer = {
    name: 'Alice',
    cat: {
    name: 'Dinah'
    }
    };
    const dogName = adventurer.cat?.name;
    console.log(dogName);

    16)what is function in js
    A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
    Function parameters are listed in the parentheses ().
    Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is called.
    function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
    // code to be executed
    }
    17)

    Math.E // returns Euler's number
    Math.PI // returns PI
    Math.SQRT2 // returns the square root of 2
    Math.SQRT1_2 // returns the square root of 1/2

    Math.sqrt(x) returns the square root of x: Math.sqrt(64); // returns 8
    Math.random() returns a random number Math.floor(Math.random() * 10); // between 0-10

    20) WHAT ARE THE CONDITION PROPERTY N TYPE

    Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
    i) IF CONDITION - IF statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true
    if (condition1) {
    // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
    } else if (condition2) {
    // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
    } else {
    // block of code
    }

    21) What is the ternary operator

    A ternary operator evaluates ( check ) a condition and executes a block of code based on the condition.
    Its syntax is:
    condition ? expression1true : expression2 false
    TERNARY OPERATOR:-
    grade = (marks < 30) ? 'Fail' : 'Pass' ; multiple Ternary operetor var grade=(marks < 30) ? 'Fail' : (marks < 60)
        ? 'Pass' : (marks < 90) ? 'Distinction' : 'High Distinction' ; 22) What is the while loop :- In while loop check
        condition.if condition True the statement continues to execute. When condition becomes false, the statement
        stops executing. while (condition) { statement } //Infinite loop let e=0; while (e>= 0) {
        e++;
        }

        23) what is the do while loop:-

        The first thing that happens in this loop is the statement is executed. Once that happens, condition is checked.
        If condition evaluates to true, the statement executes again.
        The statement keeps executing until condition evaluates to false.
        do {
        statement
        } while (condition);

        24)what is the FOR LOOP
        The for loop repeats a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. It is typically used to execute a
        block of code for certain number of times. Its syntax is:
        for(initialization; condition; increment) {
        // Code to be executed
        }
        25) what is the FOR IN LOOP

        The for-in loop is a special type of a loop that iterates over the properties of an object, or the elements of
        an array.
        const arr = [ 'hello', 1, 'JavaScript' ];
        for (let x in arr) {
        console.log(arr[x]);
        }
        const salaries= { Jack : 24000, Paul : 34000, Monica : 55000 }
        // using for...in
        for ( let i in salaries) {
        // add a currency symbol
        let salary = "$" + salaries[i];
        // display the values
        console.log(`${i} : ${salary}`);
        }

        26) What is the FOR OF loop in js

        The for..of loop in JavaScript allows you to iterate over iterable (arrays, sets, maps, strings etc). its not
        work on the object
        ***for...of with Arrays
        const students = ['John', 'Sara', 'Jack'];
        for ( let val of students ) {
        console.log(val);
        }
        ***for...of with Strings
        const string = 'code'
        for (let i of string) {
        console.log(i);
        }
        27) what is While loop

        The while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement as long as the test condition evaluates
        to true.
        let n = 0; while (n < 3) { n++ } console.log(n); 28) what is Do while loop The condition is evaluated after
            executing the statement, resulting in the specified statement executing at least once. let result='' ; let
            i=0; do { i=i + 1; result=result + i; } while (i < 5); console.log(result); 29)What is a Switch Statement? a
            switch statement is a control-flow statement that tests the value of an expression against multiple cases.
            switch statement can be an alternative to an if else statement // program for a simple calculator let
            result; const operator=prompt('Enter operator ( either +, -, * or / ): ');
const num1 = parseFloat(prompt(' Enter first number: '));
const num2 = parseFloat(prompt(' Enter second number: '));

switch(operator) {
    case ' +': result=num1 + num2; console.log(`${num1} + ${num2}=${result}`); break; case '-' : result=num1 - num2;
            console.log(`${num1} - ${num2}=${result}`); break; case '*' : result=num1 * num2; console.log(`${num1} *
            ${num2}=${result}`); break; case '/' : result=num1 / num2; console.log(`${num1} / ${num2}=${result}`);
            break; default: console.log('Invalid operator'); break; } 30) what is the if else The if/else statement
            executes a block of code if a specified condition is true. if (condition1) { // code to be executed if
            condition1 is true } else if (condition2) { // code to be executed if condition2 is true } else { // code to
            be executed if both false } 16)what is function in js A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to
            perform a particular task. Function parameters are listed in the parentheses (). Function makes the code
            reusable. You can declare it once and use it multiple times. Function makes the program easier as each small
            task is divided into a function. Function increases readability. Function arguments are the values received
            by the function when it is called. function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) { // code to be
            executed } Q9. What is a name function in JavaScript & how to define it? A named function declares a name as
            soon as it is defined. It can be defined using function keyword as : function named(){ // write code here }
            17) what is the anonymous function in js Aonymous function is a function without a name We often use
            anonymous functions as arguments of other functions. For example: setTimeout(function () {
            console.log('Execute later after 1 second') }, 1000); 32)What is immediately invoked function expression in
            Javascript? when a function is invoked immediately, even without the instantiation (function(){ const
            sayHello='Hello' ; console.log(sayHello); })(); 33) what is the currying Currying is a technique of
            evaluating function with multiple arguments, into sequence of functions with single argument function sum(a,
            b, c) { return a + b + c; } let curriedSum=curry(sum); alert( curriedSum(1, 2, 3) ); // 6, still callable
            normally alert( curriedSum(1)(2,3) ); // 6, currying of 1st arg alert( curriedSum(1)(2)(3) ); // 6, full
            currying add(3, 4); // returns 7 34) what is return statemet The return statement stops the execution of a
            function and returns a value from that function. 35) what is the call back function A callback is a function
            passed as an argument to another function. A callback is a function that will be executed after another
            function gets executed. If we want to execute a function right after the return of some other function, then
            callbacks can be used. 36)what is the arrow function ES6 Arrow functions are anonymous functions (the
            functions without a name and not bound with an identifier). They don't return any value and can declare
            without the function keyword. Arrow functions cannot be used as the constructors
            ----------------------------- function Car (model, year, reg_no) { this.model=model; this.year=year;
            this.reg_no=reg_no; }; let my_chevy=new Car("Chevrolet", 2015, "CHE-2015" ); let my_prius=new Car("Toyota",
            2020, "TOY-2020" ); console.log(my_chevy); console.log(my_prius); ----------------------------- 37)What is
            argument objects in JavaScript & how to get the type of arguments passed to a function? JavaScript variable
            arguments represents the arguments that are passed to a function. Using typeof operator, we can get the type
            of arguments passed to a function. For example − function func(x){ console.log(typeof x, arguments.length);
            } func(); //==> "undefined", 0
            func(7); //==> "number", 1
            func("1", "2", "3"); //==> "string", 3'

            38) Q12. What are the scopes of a variable in JavaScript?

            The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variable will have
            only two scopes
            • Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it is visible everywhere in your
            JavaScript code.
            • Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function
            parameters are always local to that function.


            39) What is the Hoisting in js
            Hoisting is a default behaviour of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on
            top.
            hoi= 3;
            console.log(hoi); // outputs 3 even when the variable is declared after it is initialized
            var hoi;

            40) Explain Implicit Type Coercion in javascript.
            Implicit type coercion in javascript is automatic conversion of value from one data type to another.
            It takes place when the operands of an expression are of different data types.
            var x = 3;
            var y = "3";
            x + y // Returns "33"


            41) What is the Higher Order function in js

            Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their
            results.

            42) what is the lexical scope

            Lexical scope is the ability for a function scope to access variables from the parent scope.

            43)What is a Closure?
            A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
            with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).

            is the ability to access variables from the parent scope.

            44) What is the Prototype

            The prototype is an object that is associated with every functions and objects by default in JavaScript,
            where function's prototype property is accessible and modifiable and object's prototype property (aka
            attribute) is not visible.

            45) What is the Constructor

            Constructor functions technically are regular functions. There are two conventions though:
            They are named with capital letter first.
            They should be executed only with "new" operator.

            46) What is the Promises?

            Promises are useful when you have to handle more than one asynchronous task, one after another.
            The then() method is called when the promise is resolved successfully.
            The catch() method is used with the callback when the promise is rejected or if an error occurs.

            Example:
            api().then(function(result) {
            return api2() ;
            }).then(function(result2) {
            return api3();
            }).then(function(result3) {
            // do work
            }).catch(function(error) {
            //handle any error that may occur before this point
            });

            47) What is the Async Await
            Async/await helps with writing completely synchronous-looking code while performing asynchronous tasks.
            await is used to wait for a promise to resolve or reject, and can only be used inside an asynchronous
            function.
            its es7 features.

            async function j(){
            const q = await
            }

            const q= async () =>{
            const e = await
            }

            8888eval() is a global function in JavaScript that evaluates a specified string as JavaScript code and
            executes it.

            48) What is the DOM

            DOM allows us to interact with the webpage via Javascript. The entire webpage is considered as a Document
            that is made up of different
            elements or objects ex : buttons, links , paragraphs. When the HTML is parsed by the browser it creates a
            DOM tree with the root element as Document.

            the document object model (DOM) is an "application programming interface for valid HTML and well-formed XML
            documents.
            It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated".

            48) What is the BOM

            BOM -> Browser Object Model is a larger representation of everything provided by the browser including the
            current document, location, history,
            frames, and any other functionality the browser may expose to JavaScript. The Browser Object Model is not
            standardized and can change based on different browsers.
            The BOM (Browser Object Model) consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location and document
            which are children of window.

            49) Top 10 Essential JavaScript DOM methods List

            1) getElementId : let myVar = document.getElementById(“my_squad”);
            getElementId is a method to access any element virtually. It accesses the first element with the specified
            ID.
            2) getElementsByTagName : let myVar= document.getElementsByTagName(“abc”);
            3)getElementsByClassName : let para=document.getElementsByClassName(classname)
            4) getElementsByName : var x = document.getElementsByName("fname");
            5)querySelector : let class= document.querySelector(".example");
            6)querySelectorAll : var x = document.querySelectorAll(".example");

            7) Node: Any element on a page including text & whitespaces of a DOM structure is known as “NODE.” Nodes can
            be between XHTML Tags.

            Nodes available in DOM:
            node.childNodes
            node.firstChild
            node.lastChild
            node.parentNode
            node.nextSibling
            node.previousSibling

            8) createElement :var btn = document.createElement("BUTTON"); Create a HTML element

            9) appendChild() This method is used to create a text node as the last child of the node.
            var node = document.createElement("LI"); // Create a <li> node
                var textnode = document.createTextNode("Water"); // Create a text node
                node.appendChild(textnode); // Append the text to
            <li>
                document.getElementById("myList").appendChild(node); // Append
            <li> to <ul> with id="myList"

                    9) removeChild:
                    var myLinkList = document.getElementById(“list”)
                    var myRemovedLink = myLinkList.lastChild;
                    myLinkList.removeChild(myRemoveLink);

                    7) getAttribute: you can access the value of any attribute of an element on a page.
                    var myLinkFive = document.getElementById(“Prod_5”);
                    var myLinkAttribute = myLinkFive.getAttribute(“abc”);

                    8) setAttribute:A useful method to replace values in the attribute. Assigning a new value to an
                    existing attribute is done using setAttribute.
                    Var myLinkFive = document.getElementById(“Prod_5);
                    myLinkFive.setAttribute(“abc”, ”Awesome”);

                    10) removeAttribute document.getElementById("myAnchor").removeAttribute("href");

                    11) remove() The remove() method removes the element from the DOM.
                    var myobj = document.getElementById("demo");
                    myobj.remove();

                    12) innerHTML:
                    Var myContentHolder = document.getElementById(“abc”);
                    myContentHolder.innerHTML = “<p> These are the most essential DOM methods in JavaScript</p>”;

                    13) var text = document.createTextNode("hii i am adam:");

                    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->
                    1)What is the react js
                    ReactJS is a free and open - source front - end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or
                    UI components.
                    React can be used as a base in the development of single - page or mobile applications.
                    It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.'
                    It is an open - source, component - based, front - end library responsible only for the
                    application’s view layer.

                    2) Why React ?
                    Virtual DOM:
                    Server - Side Rendering:
                    Easy creation of dynamic applications:
                    Improved performance:
                    Reusable components:
                    Unidirectional data flow
                    Dedicated tools for easy debugging:
                    It can be used for the development of both web and mobile apps:


                    3) what is the virtual dom
                    The virtual DOM is only a virtual representation of the DOM.
                    Everytime the state of our application changes, the virtual DOM gets updated instead of the real
                    DOM.


                    2) Differentiate between Real DOM and Virtual DOM.
                    Real DOM Virtual DOM
                    1. It updates slow. 1. It updates faster.
                    2. Can directly update HTML. 2. Can’t directly update HTML.
                    3. Creates a new DOM if element updates. 3. Updates the JSX if element updates.
                    4. DOM manipulation is very expensive. 4. DOM manipulation is very easy.
                    5. Too much of memory wastage. 5. No memory wastage.

                    3. What are the features of React ?
                    It uses the virtual DOM instead of the real DOM.
                    It uses server - side rendering.
                    It follows uni - directional data flow or data binding.

                    4) what is the model view controller
                    The Model - View - Controller(MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into
                    three main logical
                    components: the model, the view, and the controller.



                    4) What is the JSX - JavaScript Syntax Extension
                    JSX allows us to write HTML directly within the JavaScript code.
                    This makes the code easier to understand and debug, as it avoids the usage of complex JavaScript DOM
                    structures.
                    JSX stands for JavaScript XML.It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript.It allows us to directly
                    write HTML in React


                    5) Why Jsx
                    Advantages of JSX:
                    JSX makes it easier to write or add HTML in React.
                    JSX can easily convert HTML tags to react elements.
                    It is faster than regular JavaScript.
                    JSX allows us to put HTML elements in DOM without using appendChild() or createElement() method.
                    As JSX is an expression, we can use it inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to
                    variables, accept it as
                    arguments, or return it from functions.
                    JSX prevents XSS(cross - site - scripting) attacks popularly known as injection attacks.
                    It is type - safe, and most of the errors can be found at compilation time.

                    8) What is the State
                    The state is a built -in React object that is used to contain data or information about the
                    component.
                    The state in a component can change over time, and whenever the component re - renders.

                    11)what is the props(propertise)
                    It provides a way to pass data from one component to other components in the same way as arguments
                    are passed in a
                    function.
                    Props are passed to components like function arguments.
                    Props can be passed to components only via parent to child.
                    Props data is immutable(read - only).


                    12) What is difference between props and state
                    State Props
                    Use Case State is used to store the data of the components that have to be rendered to the view
                    Props are used to pass
                    data and event handlers to the children components
                    Mutability State holds the data and can change over time Props are immutable—once set, props can't
                    be changed
                    Component State can only be used in class components Props can be used in both functional and class
                    components
                    Updation Event handlers generally update state The parent component sets props for the children
                    components



                    5) what is the Components ***

                    Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of
                    multiple components.
                    A component is essentially a piece of the user interface.React splits the UI into independent,
                    reusable parts that can
                    be processed separately.

                    There are two types of components in React:

                    1) function components
                    2) class componets

                    6) what is Function Components
                    These components have no state they have only render method, so they are also called stateless
                    components.

                    ==> It is just simple function which return JSX.
                    ==> Functional component doesn't have render() method.
                    ==> In functional component we can use only props not state.
                    ==> We can not use react's lifecycle methods inside functional component

                    7) What is the Class Components

                    These components can hold and manage their state and have a separate render method for returning JSX
                    on the screen.
                    They are also called stateful components, as they can have a state.''

                    ==> It is also retruns JSX.
                    ==> It has render() method.
                    ==> In class component we can use both props and state.
                    ==> We can use react's lifecycle methods inside class component.

                    8) What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components ?
                    Controlled Components Uncontrolled Components
                    1. They do not maintain their own state 1. They maintain their own state
                    2. Data is controlled by the parent component *
                    2. Data is controlled by the DOM *
                    3. They take in the current values through props and then notify the changes via callbacks 3. Refs
                    are used to get their
                    current values

                    13) What are Component Lifecycle Methods ?
                    The component lifecycle methods are divided among three different phases, as -
                    1 Mounting
                    Mounting is the phase in which our React component mounts on the DOM
                    2 Updating
                    After the mounting phase where the component has been created, the update phase comes into the
                    scene.This is where
                    components state changes and hence, re - rendering takes place.
                    3 Unmounting
                    s This is the last phase in the components lifecycle.As the name clearly suggests, the component
                    gets unmounted from the
                    DOM in this phase.

                    13)Explain the lifecycle methods of components.
                    getInitialState(): Is executed before the creation of the component.
                    componentDidMount(): Is executed when the component gets rendered and placed on the DOM.
                    shouldComponentUpdate(): Is called when a component determines changes to the DOM and returns a
                    “true” or “false” value
                    based on certain conditions.
                    componentDidUpdate(): Is called immediately after rendering takes place.
                    componentWillUnmount(): Is called immediately before a component is destroyed and unmounted
                    permanently.
                    componentWillMount() This method is called just before a component mounts on the DOM or the render
                    method is called
                    componentWillUpdate() This method is called before the unmounting of the component takes
                    place.Before the removal of the
                    component from the DOM



                    14) Mounting * * * * * * * * * * * *
                    This phase comes onto the scene after the initialization phase is completed.
                    In this phase, our component renders the first time.The methods that are available in this phase
                    are:
                    1. componentWillMount()
                    This method is called just before a component mounts on the DOM or the render method is called.After
                    this method, the
                    component gets mounted.
                    2. componentDidMount()
                    This method is called after the component gets mounted on the DOM.

                    15) Updating
                    In this phase, the data of the component(state & props) updates in response to user events like
                    clicking, typing and so
                    on.This results in the re - rendering of the component.
                    The methods that are available in this phase are:
                    1.shouldComponentUpdate()
                    This method determines whether the component should be updated or not.By default, it returns true.
                    But at some point, if you want to re - render the component on some condition, then
                    shouldComponentUpdate method is
                    invoke.
                    or Is invoked when a component determines changes to the DOM and returns a “true” or “false” value
                    based on certain
                    conditions.
                    2. componentWillUpdate()
                    It is called once after the‘shouldComponentUpdate method.
                    If you want to perform some calculation before re - rendering of the component and after updating
                    the state and prop,
                    then this is the best place to do it.
                    3. ComponentDidUpdate()
                    This method is called just after the re - rendering of the component.
                    After the new (updated) component gets updated on the DOM, the‘componentDidUpdate’method is
                    executed.
                    This method receives arguments like prevProps and prevState.
                    16) Unmounting
                    This is the last phase in the components lifecycle.As the name clearly suggests, the component gets
                    unmounted from the
                    DOM in this phase.
                    The method that is available in this phase is:
                    1. componentWillUnmount()
                    This method is called before the unmounting of the component takes place.Before the removal of the
                    component from the
                    DOM, ‘componentWillUnMount’ executes.
                    This method denotes the end of the components lifecycle.

                    16) What is the Hooks
                    Hooks are the functions that allows you to use React state and lifecycle features in function
                    components.It does not
                    work inside classes.

                    Hooks are a new feature added in React v16.8.It allows to use all React features without writing
                    class components. For example, before version 16.8, we need a class component to manage state of
                    a component.Now we can keep state in a functional component using useState hook.

                    17) what is the useState ?
                    The useState() hook allows React developers to update, handle and manipulate state inside functional
                    components without
                    needing to convert it to a class component
                    ex-- const [state, setState] = useState(initialstate)
                    ex-- const [sum, setsum] = useState(function generateRandomInteger() { 5 + 7);}) we can write
                    function inside ;

                    18)what is the useEffect ?
                    React useEffect is a function that gets executed for 3 different React component lifecycles.
                    Those lifecycles are componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount lifecycles.
                    useEffect(callback, dependencies)

                    useEffect(() => {
                    effect
                    return () => {
                    clean
                    }, [])

                    19)Does useEffect run after every render ?
                    Yes! By default, it runs both after the first render and after every update.

                    20) What is the useContext
                    useContext hook allows passing data to children elements without using redux.
                    React Context is a powerful state management feature in React.
                    Instead of passing the props down through each component, React Context allows you to broadcast
                    props to the components
                    below.

                    import React from "react";
                    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
                    const NumberContext = React.createContext();
                    function App() {
                    return (
                    <NumberContext.Provider value={42}>
                        <Display />
                    </NumberContext.Provider>
                    );
                    }

                    import React, { useContext } from 'react';
                    function Display() {
                    const value = useContext(NumberContext);
                    return <div>The answer is {value}.</div>;
                    }



                    21)What is the Pure Component
                    Pure Components in React are the components which do not re - renders when the value of state and
                    props has been updated
                    with the same values.
                    We can convert component to pure component as below : -
                    For class components react provides React.PureComponent base class.
                    For Functional component react provides React.memo HOC(Higher Order Component).

                    22)what is the React Memo hooks
                    React.memo() is similar to PureComponent in that it will help us control when our components
                    rerender.
                    Components will only rerender if its props have changed!
                    Normally all of our React components in our tree will go through a render when changes are made.
                    With PureComponent and React.memo(), we can have only some components render.

                    23) How to prevent re - renders in React ?
                    Reason for re - renders in React:
                    Re - rendering of a component and it’s child components occur when props or state of the component
                    has been changed.
                    shouldComponentUpdate() method, which prevents the child component from re - rendering.
                    useing the React memo and pure components

                    21)What is Pure Functions ? (optional)
                    In Javascript, when functions returns same output when same input is passed is called Pure
                    functions.
                    It is like returning same data for same input.So in pure function output only depend on its input
                    arguments.
                    Pure functions does not produced any side effects as well.In past you may have already created so
                    many pure function.

                    25) what is the error boundry ?
                    if we get any JavaScript errors inside components, it corrupts the React ? s internal state and put
                    React in a broken
                    state on next renders.
                    There are no ways to handle these errors in React components, nor it provides any methods to recover
                    from them.
                    But, React 16 introduces a new concept to handle the errors by using the error boundaries - Now, if
                    any JavaScript error
                    found in a part of the UI, it does not break the whole app.

                    Error boundaries are React components which catch JavaScript errors anywhere in our app, log those
                    errors, and display a
                    fallback UI.
                    It does not break the whole app component tree and only renders the fallback UI whenever an error
                    occurred in a
                    component.
                    Error boundaries catch errors during rendering in component lifecycle methods, and constructors of
                    the whole tree below
                    them.

                    26 ) useDispatch hook

                    In react - redux the useDispatch hook gives us access to our store's dispatch method. Dispatch is
                    used to send actions
                    into our redux store and is the only way we can affect
                    the store from within a component.

                    The only works with function components.Class components cannot use hooks and need to use the legacy
                    connect higher
                    order component and a mapDispatchToProps function to
                    gain a way to dispatch actions from components.

                    27 ) Redux is an open - source JavaScript library for managing application state.It is most commonly
                    used with libraries
                    such as React or Angular for building user interface

                    28 ) Allows you to extract data from the Redux store state, using a selector function.
