callback

A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function 
and It is executed later,typically after the completion of an asynchronous operation or event. 

Callbacks are commonly used in programming to handle asynchronous tasks, such as fetching data from a server, reading files, or handling user interactions.



================================================================================
how handle asynchronous operations 

Handling asynchronous operations in programming involves
managing tasks that may take variable amounts of time to complete without blocking the execution of other code.

Asynchronous operations can be handled using various techniques, including callbacks, Promises, async/await, and event listeners

================================================================================
Callback hell

Callback hell is a phenomenon where a Callback is called inside another Callback. 
It is the nesting of multiple Callbacks inside a function. 

where multiple asynchronous operations are nested within each other as callbacks. This can result in code that is difficult to read, understand, and maintain

 The two common ways of escaping the callback heare are by using promises and async/await.

Why middleware is required in React?
In React applications, asynchronous operations like making API calls or handling side effects can be managed effectively using middleware. 
Middleware allows developers to intercept certain actions, perform asynchronous tasks, and then dispatch new actions with the results once the tasks are complete.

curried function

 curried function is a function that takes one argument at a time, returning a new function each time, until all arguments are provided and the final result is returned.

In JavaScript, a curried function is a function that takes one argument at a time, returning a new function each time, until all arguments are provided and the final result is returned. This allows for partial application and greater flexibility in function composition and usage.


function add(a) {
    return function(b) {
        return function(c) {
            return function(d) {
                return a + b + c + d;
            };
        };
    };
}


const result = add(1)(2)(3)(4); // Result: 10
console.log(result);





function calculateDiscount(baseDiscount) {
    return function(minimumPurchase) {
        return function(isPremiumCustomer) {
            return function(amount) {
                let discount = baseDiscount;
                if (minimumPurchase && amount >= minimumPurchase) {
                    discount += 10; // Additional discount for reaching minimum purchase
                }
                if (isPremiumCustomer) {
                    discount += 5; // Additional discount for premium customers
                }
                return amount - (amount * (discount / 100));
            };
        };
    };
}

// Apply discounts based on different criteria
const discountCalculator = calculateDiscount(15)(100)(true);
const finalPrice = discountCalculator(200); // Result: $170

console.log(finalPrice); // Output: 170





Suppose you're building an e-commerce platform, and you have a function that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart. However, different customers may have different discounts based on their membership level. You want to create a flexible function that can calculate the total price for any customer, taking into account their membership discount.

<script>
// Curried function to calculate total price with discount
function calculateTotalPrice(discount) {
  return function(items) {
    const totalPrice = items.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.price, 0);
    return totalPrice * (1 - discount);
  };
}

// Sample shopping cart items
const cartItems = [
  { name: 'Product A', price: 20 },
  { name: 'Product B', price: 30 },
  { name: 'Product C', price: 40 }
];

// Define discount rates for different membership levels
const standardDiscount = 0.1; // 10% discount for standard members

// Create specialized version of the calculateTotalPrice function for standard members
const calculateTotalPriceForStandardMember = calculateTotalPrice(standardDiscount);

// Calculate total price for standard member
const totalPriceForStandardMember = calculateTotalPriceForStandardMember(cartItems);

console.log("Total price for standard member:", totalPriceForStandardMember); // Output: 81 (10% discount applied)


<script>

 debounce and throttling in JavaScript along with unordered lists and examples of code for each concept.

### Debounce

**Debounce** ensures that a function is only executed after a specified delay period has passed since the last time the function was invoked. 

It is useful for limiting the rate at which a function is executed, especially in response to events that can fire in rapid succession, such as keystrokes or window resizing.

#### Key Points:
- Delays execution of a function until after a specified wait time.
- Useful for scenarios like search input fields, window resizing, etc.
- Prevents a function from being called too frequently.

#### Example:
html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Debounce Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <input type="text" id="search" placeholder="Type to search...">
    <script>
        function debounce(func, wait) {
            let timeout;
            return function(...args) {
                clearTimeout(timeout);
                timeout = setTimeout(() => {
                    func.apply(this, args);
                }, wait);
            };
        }

        function searchQuery() {
            console.log('Searching for:', document.getElementById('search').value);
        }

        const debouncedSearch = debounce(searchQuery, 300);

        document.getElementById('search').addEventListener('input', debouncedSearch);
    </script>
</body>
</html>


### Throttling

**Throttling** ensures that a function is only executed at most once in a specified time period. It limits the rate at which a function can be executed, regardless of how many times an event fires in that period.

#### Key Points:
- Limits the frequency of function execution to at most once per specified time period.
- Useful for scenarios like scroll events, mouse movement, etc.
- Ensures a function is not called more often than the specified time interval.

#### Example:
html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Throttling Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="content" style="height: 1500px; background: linear-gradient(white, black);">
        Scroll down to see the effect in the console log.
    </div>
    <script>
        function throttle(func, limit) {
            let lastFunc;
            let lastRan;
            return function(...args) {
                const context = this;
                if (!lastRan) {
                    func.apply(context, args);
                    lastRan = Date.now();
                } else {
                    clearTimeout(lastFunc);
                    lastFunc = setTimeout(function() {
                        if ((Date.now() - lastRan) >= limit) {
                            func.apply(context, args);
                            lastRan = Date.now();
                        }
                    }, limit - (Date.now() - lastRan));
                }
            };
        }

        function onScroll() {
            console.log('Scroll event triggered at:', new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
        }

        const throttledScroll = throttle(onScroll, 1000);

        window.addEventListener('scroll', throttledScroll);
    </script>
</body>
</html>


### Summary
- **Debounce** delays the execution of a function until after a specified wait time has passed since the last invocation.



- **Throttling** ensures that a function is called at most once in a specified time period.

Both techniques help in optimizing performance and improving user experience by controlling the rate of function execution in response to frequent events.

Certainly! Here are the concise explanations with code examples:

1. **Split Method**:
   - Splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator.
   ```javascript
   const str = "Hello,World";
   const arr = str.split(","); // ['Hello', 'World']
   ```

2. **Reverse Method**:
   - Reverses the order of elements in an array.
   ```javascript
   const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   arr.reverse(); // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
   ```

3. **Join Method**:
   - Joins all elements of an array into a single string, separated by a specified separator.
   ```javascript
   const arr = ['Hello', 'World'];
   const str = arr.join(", "); // 'Hello, World'
   ```

These examples demonstrate how each method works in a simple and straightforward manner.
