=================================================================================================================
let and const var keywords

In javascript to declare a variable you can use 'var' keyword, but since ES6 there are 2 more keywords
introduced to declare the variables.



var:-
- it is hoisted
- It is not block scoped
- It is rewritable


let:-
- It is not hoisted
- It is block scoped
- It is rewritable


const:-
- It is not hoisted
- It is block scoped
- It is readonly


Note:- Prefer using const if you do not have to change the value of the declared variable.



- var:
  - Hoisting: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope. This means you can access a `var` variable before it's declared.
  - Scope: `var` variables are function-scoped, meaning they are accessible throughout the function in which they are defined.
  - Mutability: `var` variables can be reassigned and their values can be changed.

- let:
  - Hoisting: Variables declared with `let` are hoisted to the top of their block scope, but not initialized. Accessing them before the declaration results in a ReferenceError.
  - Scope: `let` variables are block-scoped, meaning they are accessible only within the block (curly braces) in which they are defined.
  - Mutability: `let` variables can be reassigned, allowing for flexibility in value assignment within the block scope.

- const:
  - Hoisting: Like `let`, variables declared with `const` are hoisted to the top of their block scope, but not initialized. Accessing them before the declaration results in a ReferenceError.
  - Scope: `const` variables are block-scoped, similar to `let`, meaning they are accessible only within the block (curly braces) in which they are defined.
  - Immutability: `const` variables are read-only and cannot be reassigned once they are initialized. However, the object or array they point to may still be mutable.

Best Practices:
- Use `const` by default when declaring variables that won't be reassigned. This promotes immutability and enhances code readability.
- If you need to reassign a variable, use `let`. This clearly communicates your intent to allow variable mutation within a block scope.
- Minimize the usage of `var` as it has function scope, which can lead to unexpected behavior, especially in larger codebases.

By adhering to these best practices, you can write more predictable and maintainable JavaScript code, taking advantage of the scoping rules and immutability offered by `let` and `const`.


//================================= Closure ========================
## Closure:-
-A closure is a combination of a nested function and lexical scope
-By using closure a nested function can use the variable of outer function.
-A lexical scope in JavaScript means that a variable defined outside a function can
be accessible inside another function




clousure inner function can be access of outer function
=============================================================================================================

Object destructuring:-
Object destructuring is used to declare and initialzize variables by extracting the values from
object properties.

const person = {
name: "Topper Skills",
mobile: "7875580668",
email: "topperskills@gmail.com",
city: "Pune",
};

without Object destructuring
const phone = person.mobile;

const email = person.email;

const city = person.city;

with Object destructuring
Property name and variable name must be same
const { mobile: phone, email, city } = person;

console.log(phone, email, city);

====================================================================================================

// Array Destructuring:-

const nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100];

const a = nums[0];
const b = nums[1];
const c = nums[2];
const d = nums[4];
with destructuring

const [a, b, c, d] = nums;

console.log(a, b, c, d);


//============================Object.keys, values, entries =============


For plain objects, the following methods are available:

Object.keys(obj) – returns an array of keys.
Object.values(obj) – returns an array of values.
Object.entries(obj) – returns an array of [key, value] pairs.

const object1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100];

var key =Object.keys(object1);
var val =Object.values(object1)
var entries =Object.entries(object1)

console.log(key);\\> Array ["0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]

console.log(...val);\\ 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\\> Array [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]

console.log(...entries); \\Array ["0", 10] Array ["1", 20] Array ["2", 30] Array ["3", 40] Array ["4", 50] Array ["5",
60] Array ["6", 70] Array["7", 80] Array ["8", 90] Array ["9", 100]

// expected output: Array ["a", "b", "c"]


//=================================Spread operator==========================

Spread operator:-
It is used to extract elements of an array or to extract properties from an iterable object.

const arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100];

console.log(...arr);

const per = {
name: "TOpper Skills",
mobile: "7875580668",
email: "topperskills@gmail.com",
};
const iterObj = Object.keys(per);
console.log(...iterObj);\\name mobile email



======================================Rest operator:-========================


Rest operator:-
-The rest operator is used to store all the arguments which do not have matching parameters.
-The rest is an array.
-Rest operator basic help to pass infinite number of argument in a function

Example:

function add(a, b, ...args) {
console.log(a, b);
console.log(args);
}

add(10, 20);
add(10, 20, 30, 40, 50);

//============================ arguments object vs rest operator===================================

##= arguments object vs rest operator =##

-Arguments is an object.
-rest is an array

-Arguments gives the details of a function call including caller, callee, arguments.
-Rest operator does not give details about the function call, it gives only the arguments which do not have
matching parameters

-Arguments object gives all the arguments despite those arguments have matching parameters or not
-Rest oeprator does not give the arguments which have matching parameters

-The arguments object is built-in
-The rest operation is not built, you need to declare it after all the parameters of a function



========================== typeof ==================================

Q1: What is typeof operator?

JavaScript provides a typeof operator that can examine a value and tell you what type it is:
var a;
typeof a; // "undefined"

a = "hello world";
typeof a; // "string"

a = 42;
typeof a; // "number"

a = true;
typeof a; // "boolean"

a = null;
typeof a; // "object" -- weird, bug

a = undefined;
typeof a; // "undefined"

a = { b: "c" };
typeof a; // "object"

========================== ES6 features ==================================

Below is the list of top ES6 features every JavaScript developer should know,

Default parameters
Spread and Rest syntaxes (…)
let and const
promise
Destructuring assignment
Arrow function expressions
Classes

Template literals (Template strings)
Tagged Templates
Object.assign() and Object.is()

========================== Prototype ==================================
Prototype:-



-Javascript is a Prototype based language.
-In javascript there is a build in function called "Object"
-Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.

-Prototype is an object to which other objects can inherit to achieve reusability.
-The prototype of Object function is the prototype of all the objects created in Javascript
-In Javascript with each function an anonymous object gets created called prototype object.



Accessing prototype
There are 2 ways to access the prototype object.

1. By using dunder proto

_propo_

2. By using Object.setPrototypeOf()



Definition: In JavaScript, a prototype is an object that serves as a template for other objects to inherit properties and methods.
Prototypes enable objects to inherit behavior and promote code reusability by sharing properties and methods among multiple instances.

//==============================JavaScript Use Strict=========================
The "use strict" directive was new in ECMAScript version 5

purpose of "use strict" is to indicate that the code should be executed in "strict mode".
 With strict mode, you can
not, use undeclared variables.


//============================== Noraml function vs arrow function =========================

A]Noraml function

-this value inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on the invocation.
-Noraml functions created using function declarations or expressions
-In normal function arguments object are available
-Arguments object gives the details of a function call including caller, callee, arguments.
-Noraml functions are constructible, invoked with the new keyword
-Noraml functions used have duplicate named parameters
-Noraml function is hoisted


B]Arrow function
-In the arrow function 'this' always refers to the context under which the function is innvoced.
-arrow function is introduce in ES6 version
-In Arrow function arguments object NOT available
-arrow function cannot be used as a constructor. NOT invoked with the new keyword
-Arrow functions can never have duplicate named parameters, whether in strict or non-strict mode.
-Arrow function is Not hoisted


-Arrow function — also called fat arrow function
-Curly brackets aren’t required if only one expression is present.
let add = (x, y) => x + y;
-If there’s only one argument, then the parentheses are not required either:
let squareNum = x => x * x;arrow functions do not have their own this value.
 Instead, they inherit the this value from the enclosing lexical scop


//============================== call,apply,bind =========================


To call a function of a specific object you can use below methods
A] call():
-Call method is predefine method in JavaScript
-an object can use a method belonging to another object
-call method is invoke a function with given this value and argument provided by one by one

- accepts arguments as seperate values


var employee1 = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Rodson'};
var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy', lastName: 'Baily'};

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ ', '+ greeting2);
}

invite.call(employee1, 'Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.call(employee2, 'Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?







B]apply():

-apply() method is similar to call() method
-call method argument takes separately
-apply method argument takes as an array
-invoke the function with a given this value and argument provided by an array

-accepts arguments as an array elements


ar employee1 = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Rodson'};
var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy', lastName: 'Baily'};

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ ', '+ greeting2);
}

invite.apply(employee1, ['Hello', 'How are you?']); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
invite.apply(employee2, ['Hello', 'How are you?']); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?






C] bind()

- bind() method we can bind an object to a common function ,so that the
function gives different result when its need
-bind method takes an object as an first argument and create a new function



var employee1 = {firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Rodson'};
var employee2 = {firstName: 'Jimmy', lastName: 'Baily'};

function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
console.log(greeting1 + ' ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName+ ', '+ greeting2);
}

var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
inviteEmployee1('Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
inviteEmployee2('Hello', 'How are you?'); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?




- return a new function ,allow you to pass any number of argument
- it binds a function with an object and return the binded function.
It does not bind the existing function instead if create a new function to bind


##============ Object cloning============

-Crreating a duplicate object of an existing object is called object cloning

There are 2 types of object cloning

1. Shallow cloning
-In shallow cloning only direct/main object gets cloned but not the object
which are referred by the properties of main object.

-changing value of cloned object will be refect into
orginal object as well because both are point same refrance object

2. Deep cloning
-In deep cloning all the object direct/main and nested objects will be cloned.

-changing value of cloned object will be not refect into
orginal object as well because both are point different refrance object




var person = {
name: "deepak",
add: {
road: "MRG",
puc: 65
}

}
//var person2 = person;
//person2.name="wadikar"

// shallow cloning
let person2 = Object.assign({}, person)
person2.name = "patil";
person2.add.road = "pa";

//deep cloning
var p3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));
p3.add.road = "MGm3"

console.log(person)
console.log(person2)
console.log(p3)


const obj={
    name:"ABC",
    age:20,
    address:{
        city:'Beijing',
        country:'China'
    }
}
const obj2 ={...obj}
obj2.name="PQR"

const obj3 =Object.assign({},obj)
obj3.age=21

const obj4=JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))
obj4.address.city="Pune"
console.log("obj",obj);
console.log("obj2",obj2);
console.log("obj3",obj3);
console.log("obj4",obj4);



//=========================================Set====================
Set:-
Set is like an array but it stores only unique elements.

An array is used to store multiple elements of any type, an array can store duplicate
elements.

// Creating a set
1. Creating empty set.
const s1 = new Set();

// add(value) - adds an element and returns the set after adding the element



//============================map ===============================
Map:- The Map is used to store key value pairs .

A key value pair is called an entry
A key must be unique
the values can be duplicate

Creating Map

1. creating empty map

const m1 = new Map();

set()
delete()
value()
keys()


//=============================sync and asynch=================
Note:- Javascript is a Synchronous programming language.

Javascript is single threaded.

But the execution environment of the Javascript is asynchronous.

// synchronous execution

How does javascript code gets executed asynchronously when there is one thread?

=> Javascript is single threaded, synchronous but the environment in which the javascript
code gets executed is asynchronous.

The javascript runtime(event loop) performs non blocking IO operations by offloading most of the work
to operating system.
/
/callback

// To write async code you need

1. callback

A callback is a normal javascript function which is passed as an argument to
another function to perform future operation.

A callback is used to perform any future operation after an asynchronous operation.


// 2. Promise

// 3. async await



//== ==============================Higher Order function :-==============================
Higher Order function :-
A function which accepts another function as an argument is called a higher
order function.
The higher order function is used to perform different operations.

Example: addEventListener



//=================== promise =============================
Promise:
-Promise are thr ideal choice for handling asynchronous operation in simplest manner
-they can handle multiple asynchronous operation easily and provide better error handling then Callback and event
#promise has four strategist
1]fulfilled: Action related to the promise succeeded
2] Rejected : Action related to the promise failed
3] pending- Neither fulfilled nor rejected yet means promise still pending.
4]settle- The Promise has been either fulfilled or rejected.

A].then():
-then() function is invoked when a promise is resolved and a result is received.

B].catch()
catch() function is invoked when a promise is either rejected or some error has occured in execution.

Applications
Promises are used for asynchronous handling of events.
Promises are used to handle asynchronous http requests.






A promise is an object which is used to perform asynchronous operations.

A promise gets settled(either resolved or rejected) in future.

If promise gets resolved then it calls the callback passed to then() function.

If promise gets rejected then it called the callback passed to catch() function.
then chaining

Writing multiple thens one after another for a promise is called then chaining

A then() returns a promise













//===========================asynch await =========================
async await

-The async await is used to pause the execution of a function until a promise gets settled

A] - Async Keyword:

-async keyword Put the before a function , tells the function to return a Promise
- This allows the function to use the "await" keyword internally to handle asynchronous operations.


B]- Await Keyword:

 
-  "await" keyword is used within an async function to pause its execution until a Promise is settled.
- It waits for the Promise to resolve (either fulfilled or rejected) and then returns its result.
- Note: The "await" keyword can only be used inside async functions, otherwise, it would result in a SyntaxError.



-await should only be used inside the async function.

-The await keyword simply makes JavaScript wait until that Promise settles and then returns its result
-await keyword only works inside async functions, otherwise you would get a SyntaxError. 


//===========================global object =========================


Q1. what is global object in javascript?
-A global object is an object that always exists in the global scope
-In a web browser, the global object is the window object
-The global object can be accessed using the "this" operator in the global scope
-The global object in JavaScript is an always defined object that provides
variables and functions, and is available anywhere.



window is a global object of javascript it is used to load / display a web page
content in the web browser.

The window object represents a tab of a web browser, it includes navigation model, histoy,
location, document, etc.

document represents a web page in the web browser.

document object is a part of window object.

Using document object you can dynamically update the content on the viewport.

//===========================this =========================


Q2. What is this?

In JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to the current execution context. 
Its value depends on how a function is called and where it is called. 
The behavior of `this` can vary in different situations:

<!-- -The JavaScript this keyword refers to the object it belongs to. -->
-Alone, this refers to the global object.
-In a function, this refers to the global object.
-In a method, this refers to the owner object.

-In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
-In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
-Methods like call(), and apply() can refer this to any object.


It has different values depending on where it is used:




1. Global context:
 In the global scope, `this` refers to the global object, which is `window` in web browsers and `global` in Node.js.

console.log(this === window); // true in a browser environment


2. Function context: Inside a function, the value of `this` depends on how the function is called. If the function is called as a method of an object, `this` refers to that object.

const obj = {
  name: 'example',
  greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
  }
};

obj.greet(); // Output: Hello, example


3. Constructor context: When a function is used as a constructor with the `new` keyword, `this` refers to the newly created instance.

function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

const person1 = new Person('John');
console.log(person1.name); // Output: John


4. Explicit binding: You can explicitly set the value of `this` using `call()`, `apply()`, or `bind()` methods.

function greet() {
  console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
}

const obj1 = { name: 'Alice' };
const obj2 = { name: 'Bob' };

greet.call(obj1); // Output: Hello, Alice
greet.apply(obj2); // Output: Hello, Bob

const greetBob = greet.bind(obj2);
greetBob(); // Output: Hello, Bob

<button id="myButton">Click Me</button>
<script>
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log(this); // Refers to the button element
});

document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log(this); // Refers to the global object or undefined (depending on the environment), not the button element
});
</script>

Understanding the context in which `this` is used is crucial for writing effective JavaScript code.

//===========================Bubbling and Capturing =========================


A) Bubbling

-The bubbling principle is simple.
-When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it,
then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.

-With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and
then propagated to outer elements.


B] capturing

- capturing principle is simple.
-when an event happen on element ,it first run the parent element of then lastly run handler


-With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and
propagated to the inner elements.

-Capturing is also called "trickling", which helps remember the propagation order:

stopPropagation prevents further propagation of the current event in the capturing and bubbling phases.

preventDefault prevents the default action the browser makes on that event.



//===========================JavaScript =========================


Q1. What is JavaScript?


- JavaScript:    
                   -JavaScript is a lightweight and fast scripting language primarily used for client-side web development.
- Dynamic Web Pages:    
                   -With JavaScript, you can dynamically update and modify both HTML and CSS on web pages.
- Data Manipulation:    
                   -JavaScript empowers you to calculate, manipulate, and validate data, 
                   -making it an essential tool for interactive and data-driven web applications.
- Prototype-based Language:    
                   -JavaScript is a prototype-based language, meaning that objects inherit properties and methods from other objects.
- Client-Side Scripting:    
                   -JavaScript is predominantly used for client-side scripting, enabling interactive and responsive user experiences directly within the web browser.
- Dynamic Behavior:    
                   -JavaScript adds dynamic behavior to web pages, allowing for interactive elements, animations, and dynamic content updates without requiring a page reload.
- Storing Information:    
                   -JavaScript can store and manipulate data locally on the client side, facilitating tasks such as form validation, user authentication, and managing user preferences.
- Request Handling:    
                   -JavaScript can handle HTTP requests and responses asynchronously, enabling features like AJAX for fetching data from servers without refreshing the entire page.
- Cross-Platform:    
                   -JavaScript is not limited to web browsers; it is also utilized in various non-browser environments, such as server-side development (Node.js) and mobile app development (React Native, Ionic).
- Extensibility:    
                   -JavaScript's modular and flexible nature allows developers to extend its functionality through libraries, frameworks, and plugins, catering to a wide range of development needs.


JavaScript is a versatile and powerful programming language primarily used for client-side scripting on web pages. Here's a refined overview:

- JavaScript light weight and fast scripting language for web page
with help of JavaScript you can update and change both HTML and CSS.
and also calculate, manipulate and validate data.
javascript is prototype based language

-JavaScript is a very powerful language for client-side scripting language.
-JavaScript is programming language for the web,
-you can update and change both HTML and CSS.
-JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data.
-and also used in many non browesr environment.
-javascript is prototype based language

-you can use it add dynamic behavior, store information and handle request and response on a website. 


Q2 Data types available in JavaScript

#Statically typed languages:-
The langauges in which the data type of variable and
function return value is known at the time of compilation
such languages are called statically typed languages.


Example: C, C++, Java, etc

// C
int num;
num = 100; valid
num = "abcd"; invalid

#Dynamically typed languages:-

The langauges in which the data type of variable and function return value
is not known at the time of compilation such languages are called
dynamically typed languages.

Example: Javascript, Python, PHP, etc.

// Javascript
var num;
num = 100;
num = true;
num = "abcd;
--------------------------
Q.what is Datatype?
-the type of value or type of data which is assign to a variable is called ad datatypes

There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

# JavaScript is having following primitive data type
A] Primitive datatypes:-
string
number
boolean
undefined
null
bigint
Symbol

B]Derived data type
# JavaScript is having following Derived data type
object
function

1]undefined:
-this unique datatype which only available in JavaScript non in any other language
-if we just declare a variable and not assigned any value to it.
-then the default value is called undefined
e.g.
var a;
console.log(a)// undefined
console.log(typeof a)// undefined

2] null data:
if we just declare variable and assign some dummy value instead of actual value is null data type
var a = null;
console.log(a)//null
console.log( typeof a)//object

3] Number:
if we assign any numerical value or data to variable is called as number datatype

4] string:
-if we assign any textual value or data to variable
5] Boolean :
- if we assign true or false value to a variable is called as boolean Datatype

5] Symbols:
Symbols are new primitive type introduced in ES6.
Symbols are completely unique identifiers. Just like their primitive
counterparts (Number, String, Boolean),
they can be created using the factory function Symbol() which returns a Symbol.

//=====================================================================================================
Usage of Javascript: -
- To handle the user and web browser events
- To validate the user inputs
- To perform any arithmetic operations
- To Manipulate the DOM
- To create a web server using nodejs
- To perform database operations using nodejs
- To perform file operations using nodejs
- To create APIs using nodejs

Advantages of Javascript: -
- It can be executed at client side as well as server side
- It is light weight and fast
- It gets executed asynchronously
- As it gets executed inside the web browsers it improves the user experience
- High server configuration is not required

Limitation of Javascript: -
- Javascript cannot be used to perform database operations inside the web browser.
- Javascript cannot perform file operations inside the web browser

//=====================================================================================================


## How to execute javascript code ?

There are 2 places to execute the javascript code
1. Web browser

In The web browsers there is a software called Javascript engine.
Javascript engine is used to execute the javascript code.
- Embed the javascript code inside the web page using <code><script></script></code> element and load the web page
inside
the web browser.

2. Nodejs

Nodejs is a software developed using C, C++ and javascript which comes
with built in packages(small libraries) which uses the V8 javascript engine
of Google chrome to execute the javascript code.

Nodejs provides runtime environment to execute the javascript code without outside the web browser.

// Note:- Web browser specific features(like alert, window, document, etc) cannot be executed using nodejs


//=====================================================================================================

## Keywords: - The words which are reserved by the prorgamming language are
called keywords.

Example: if, else, do, while, let, const, class, var, etc.

Literal:- A constant value which can be assigned to a variable is called Literal

Example:
1000 - number literal
"abcd" - string literal
true - boolean literal
{ } - object literal
[] - array literal
etc.


//===============ECMA Script 6======================

ES6 - ECMA Script 6 - ES2015 - ECMA Script 2015

ES6 vs Javascript

ES2015 is one of the versions of ECMA Script.

ECMA Script is a specification released by the ECMA international to standardize the Javascript


ES6 is a major update in the Javascript which introduced many new features.

=========

const:-

const is used to declare a readonly variable
const variables should initialized at the time of declaration


//=====================================================================================================

Comments: - comments are the non executable statements which are used to
write the meta data about the source code.

1. Single line comment

// single line comment


2. Multi line comment/*

multi
line
comment
*/


//================================= String=================================
1] string datatype
-a string is called a sequence of characters.
-if we assign any textual value or data to variable

To represent a string value you can use either single quote (' ') or double quote(" ")


## string is 1 :-
If an object/variable cannot be modified then it is called immutable.

Why is string immutable?

- The string values are stored inside the string constant pool which
does not allows duplication of the values, if multiple variables
are storing the same value then all the variables get address of same
value. If one of the variable changes the value then same will get
changed for all remaining variables who are refering the value, this may
lead to inconsistency in the program, to avoid this problem string is made
immutable.

String concatenation:-
There are 2 ways to concat the string
1. By using concat() function

var a = "abcd";
a = a.concat("efg");//abcdefg

2. By using concatenation operator +
+ operator concat the string if one or more operator are string type
a = a + "efg";
console.log(a);



Q.7 method are use for string

//01 length:
-string.length return lenght of string.
e.g.var text="ABCD"
console.log(text.lenght)\\4

//02 indexOf()
-The indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string.
-This method returns -1 if the value to search for never occurs.
-The indexOf() method is case sensitive.

string.indexOf(searchvalue, start)

//2.1 lastIndexOf():
-The lastIndexOf() method returns the position of the last occurrence of a specified value in a string.
-This method returns -1 if the value to search for never occurs.
-The indexOf() method is case sensitive.

string.lastIndexOf(searchvalue, start)

// 03 slice()
-The slice() method extracts parts of a string and returns the extracted parts in a new string.
-it can accepts positive and negative indexes.
-if parameter is negative the position is counted from end of string
-It cannot swap the Positions


string.slice(startPositions, endPositions)
startPositions:start with zero position
endPositions:start with one position

slice(startIndex):- return substring from startIndex to
the end of string
slice(startIndex, endIndex):- returns substring from start
index to end index (endindex is excluded)


//04 substring():-
-The substring() method extracts parts of a string and returns the extracted parts in a new string.
-it can accepts only positive positions
-negative values mean 0 to start
-It swaps the positions if start position is greater than end position.
-The substring() method does not change the original string.

string.substring(start, length)




//05 substr():
-substr method extract parts of a string and retrun a new string
-It accepts start position and total length
-It cannot accepts end position


The substr() method returns a portion of the string, starting at the specified index and extending for a
given number of characters afterwards.

string.substr(start, length)






//06 replace():
-replace method replace specified value within another value in a string

-The replace() method searches a string for a specified value, or a regular expression, and returns a new string
where the specified values are replaced.

string.replace(searchvalue, newvalue)

If you are replacing a value (and not a regular expression),
only the first instance of the value will be replaced.


// 05 upperCase() and lowerCase()

-The toUpperCase() method converts a string to uppercase letters.
string.toUpperCase()

-The toLowerCase() method converts a string to lowercase letters.
string.toLowerCase()


//07 charAt():

-The charAt() method returns the character at the specified index in a string.
- returns a character of the provided position.
string.charAt(index)


//08 charCodeAt():
- return the encoding code of a character of provided position
string.charCodeAt(index)

//===================================== Number ======================================

2. Number datatype
The number datatype represents all types number.


Q.8 Method of Number
1 isNaN():
-This function return true if value is not a number ;
if number value then it will return false

-The Number.isNaN() method determines whether a value is NaN (Not-A-Number).
-NaN is a value of number type
-NaN represents an invalid number
-NaN is returned when you expects a number but got invalid number.

the global isNaN() will convert the provided value to number to check
if it is NaN or not, if value does not get converted means its NaN.

the Number.isNaN() will not convert the provided value, it just compare
the provided value or result of an expression with NaN.

Infinity
-Infinity

The positive and negative infinity values are of number datatype.

positive infinity represents a number which is very big, it is out of
capacity of the javascript engine.

negative infinity represents a number which is very small, it is out of
capacity of the javascript engine.

console.log(typeof Infinity);\\number
console.log(typeof -Infinity);\\number





//02 toExponential():
-The toExponential() method converts a number into an exponential notation.
number.toExponential(x)
where x= Optional. An integer between 0 and 20 representing the number of digits in the notation after the decimal
point.




//03 toFixed():
-toFixed() returns a string, with the number written with a specified number of decimals:
var x = 9.656;
x.toFixed(0); // returns 10
x.toFixed(2); // returns 9.66
x.toFixed(4); // returns 9.6560
x.toFixed(6); // returns 9.656000

number.toFixed(decimal)



## Converting a string value into number.
Following are the functions to convert a string into number.
1. Number()
2. parseFloat()
3. parseInt()

1. Number()
Number() - it converts the whole value into number. Only valid number numbers are converted
otherwise it returns NaN.
-Number() can also convert a date to a number:

Number(true); // returns 1
Number(false); // returns 0
Number("10"); // returns 10
Number(" 10"); // returns 10
Number("10 "); // returns 10
Number(" 10 "); // returns 10
Number("10.33"); // returns 10.33
Number("10,33"); // returns NaN
Number("10 33"); // returns NaN
Number("John"); // returns NaN

2. parseFloat()
-parseFloat() parses a string and returns a number.
-Spaces are allowed.
-If the first character cannot be converted to a number, parseFloat() returns NaN.

parseFloat(string)


-it parses a string value and extracts a valid floating/integer number
-Only the first number is returned:

parseFloat("10"); // returns 10
parseFloat("10.33"); // returns 10.33
parseFloat("10 20 30"); // returns 10
parseFloat("10 years"); // returns 10
parseFloat("years 10"); // returns NaN


3. parseInt():
-if string as float value it will return integer number.
-The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer.

-it parses a string value and extracts a valid integer number.

parseInt("10"); // returns 10
parseInt("10.33"); // returns 10
parseInt("10 20 30"); // returns 10
parseInt("10 years"); // returns 10
parseInt("years 10"); // returns NaN


//===================================JavaScript Math===========================

//01 ceil():
-The ceil() method rounds a number UPWARDS to the nearest integer, and returns the result.
-this will increment the integer part

Math.ceil(x)

Math.ceil(1.4)\\2
Math.ceil(1.9)\\2
Math.ceil(1.0)\\1

//02 floor()
-The floor() method rounds a number DOWNWARDS to the nearest integer, and returns the result.
- this will not increment the integer part

Math.floor(x)
x Required. The number you want to round

Math.floor(1.0)\\1
Math.floor(1.5)\\1
Math.floor(1.9)\\1

//03 Math.round():
-The round() method rounds a number to the nearest integer.
-2.49 will be rounded down (2),
-2.5 will be rounded up (3).

Math.round(x)
x =. The number you want to round

Math.round(2.0)\\2
Math.round(2.4)\\2
Math.round(2.5)\\3
Math.round(2.9)\\3

//04 Math.random()
-Generating a random number

//05 Math.pow(x, y):The pow() method returns the value of x to the power of y (x^y).


Math.pow(2, 2)//4
Maath.pow(3,2)//9


// Math.max()
-The min() method returns the number with the lowest value.
Math.min(5, 10);
Math.max(n1, n2, n3, ..., nX)



//Math.max()
-The max() method returns the number with the highest value.
Math.max(5, 10);
Math.max(n1, n2, n3, ..., nX)

//==============================undefined===================================================
03 undefined Datatype

-If a variable is declared but not initalized then its value will be undefined
-If a function is not returning a value then its default value will be undefined.
-If a function is a called without passing arguments then the value of that function parameters will be undefined.
-Whereever you expect a primitive value and if that value is not available then it may be undefined.

console.log(typeof undefined)\\undefined;
undefined is a value of type undefined


the undefined is used as placeholder value for variable,
parameters etc. if those are not initialized.

//==============================null===================================================
03 null Datatype

// null

The null is used in place of an object
If you do not have an object then use null
null works like a placeholder for object value.


console.log(typeof null)\\object;
null is object type value



//======================== Undefined variable vs undeclared variable ===================

undefined variable: -

If a variable is declared but not initialized then its value is undefined such variable
is called undefined variable.
- It will not give you error.
Example:

var cit

undeclared variable:-

If a variable is not yet declared means it does not exist is called undeclared variable.
The undeclared variable raises ReferenceError.

Example:
console.log(mobile);
ReferenceError: mobile is not defined

//========================== object & class =====================

A] class
-a class is a model of object
-A class defines state and behaviour of the objects
-By using a class multiple objects having similar properties can be created
-a class is not a collection of objects.

a class represents a logical entity like a category

// ES6
class Horse {

// state - properties
color;
age;
weight;
height;
name;
price;
breed;

// behaviour - methods
eating(){}
running(){}

}

B] Object

-An object is an instance of a class.
-An object can represents a real life physical as well as logical(bank account) entity.
-An object has state(current values) and behaviour (activities)

Object:-
object literal {}


e.g

##Creating an object
There are mulitple ways to create the object, following are 2 of those.

1. By using object literal
Syntax:

var objReferece = {
propertyName: propertyValue
}

Example:-
var person = {
name: "Topper Skills",
mobile: "7875580668"
}

This way is suitable if you do not want to follow any structure(state, behaviour).



2. By using new operator
Syntax:
var objReferece = new Constructor()
var objReferece = new ClassName()
var objReferece = new FunctionName()

Example:-

var per1 = new Person();


This way is preferred to create multiple objects having similar structure(state, behaviour)


## A] Object properties:-

--An object can have multiple properties separated with comma ,
A property name should follow lower camel case naming standard, means first word should be in
lower case and first letter of all the subsequent words must be in uppercase.
Example:

firstName - correct
mobile
panNumber
fileName

Note: If there is a space between property name then the name must be wrpeed in double quote
"first name"
Ex:
var person = {
"first name": "Topper",
lastName: "Skills"
}

// Note: If you want to use a variable value as property name then enclose the variable in []

var aa ="mobile"
var obj = {
firstName: "Topper",
lastName: "Skills",
[aa]: "7875580668",
};


## B] object property value:
-a value is assigned to an object property using colon :
Follwing are the possible types of values to be assign to object property
- string,
- number
- boolean
- undefined
- null
- object
- array
- function


## C] Accssing object properties


// 1. By using dot(.) operator

Syntax:
objectName.propertyName
Example:
person.firstName

this is preferred way if there is no space between property name and property name is known

2. By using []

Syntax:
objectName["propertyName"]
objectName[variableName]

Example :
person["firstName"]
person["first name"]
person[variable]



//========== Constructor function =========================================

-A javascript which is used to intialize the object properties is called constructor function
-The name of constructor function should start with uppercase

-The constructor function is used to create the similar objects.

// Example:

function Person(name, m, city) {
this.name = name;
this.mobile = m;
this.city = city;
}

var per1 = new Person("aa", "1111", "Pune");
var per2 = new Person("bbb", "2222", "Mumba");


//========== primitive vs reference variable=================
## A] primitive variables:

-primitive variables are used to store primitive values
-Primitive variables copies values from another variables

// primitive variables
let a = 10;
let b = a;
a = 20;

console.log(a); //20
console.log(b); //10


## B] reference variables:
-Reference varaibles are used to refer the objects and arrays

var x = { name: "abcd" };
var y = x;
x.name = "pqr";
console.log(x.name); //pqr
console.log(y.name); //pqr

//======================= Array =====================================

## Array:-
An array is a group of consecutive memory blocks used to store multiple values,
each block in the array is identified by a unique number called an index.
-JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
-In Javascript, an array can store any types of data.`
-As Javascript is dynamic language there is no need to mention the
size of an array while declaring, it grows dynamically.

// Array Delcaration:-

var arrayName;

Creating an Array

arrayName = []

var arrayName = new Array(length);

// Accessing array elements

1. arrayName[index];
console.log(nums[4]);






//==Method Of Array

#01. toString()
-this method is convert array value to string value separate by commas.
-this method is for convert array to string of arrays value

array.toString()

#02. join()
-The join() method returns the array as a string.
-The elements will be separated by a specified separator.
-The default separator is comma (,).

array.join(separator)

- This method is used for all join array element into string but addtional provide separator


#03. pop()
-This method is used to removes last element of array
-removes and returns last element from array.

#04. push()
-This method is used for add element to the array at the end;
-this adds the elements at the end of the array and returns total
number of elements in the array.

#05. shift()
- This method is used for the remove first element in the array

-removes and returns first element from an array


#06. unshift()
-This method is used for add element in array in the first index
-this adds the elements at the start of the array and returns
total number of elements in the array.

#07. The length property provides an easy way to append a new element to an array:

#08. The delete property provides to delete element

var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
delete fruits[0]
console.log(fruits)\\ [ "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];

#09. concat()
contact method is used to join two or more array and return new array

#10. sort()
this method is used to sort array alphabetically

#11. reverse()
-In This method is used to reverse element of the array and its decending order

#12. numeric sort() - campare funcation

var sort = numb.sort(function (a, b) {
return (a - b)
})

a = 10
b = 20
a - b
0 = equal
+ve = a is greater
-ve = a is smaller

#13. Finding total number of elements of an array
console.log(Array.length); 10

#14. splice():

=========================ECMA-5 Array Method ==================

#01.String.trim()

#02.Array.isArray:
-array.isArray- isArray() method cheak wheater object is an array
-if object is array it return true other wise is false

Array.isArray(arrayName);

#03a.forEach()
-method calls a function once for each array element
-it accepts a function having three parameters (value, index, array)
- It does not return anything
- This function is suitable to perform operatoins on existing array .

Syntax:

forEach(function(value, index, array){

})

#04.map():-
-method is create new array from another array

-The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function).
- This method used to create a new array by consisting of only those elements which satisfy a condition


The main difference between forEach and filter is that
forEach just loop over the array and executes the callback but filter
executes the callback and check its return value.
If the value is true element remains in the resulting array but if the return
value is false the element will be removed for the resulting array.

- returns true if the provided element is avaiable in the array




//======================== Function =============================
## Function:
-Function is named block of logically related statements.
-The function is used to perform a specific operation of different data
-Fucntion can accpts/takes input data using parameters
-a function can return a value

Benefits of function:-
- Code/logic reusability
- code modularity


Syntax:-
function functionName(parameters){
body
}
functionName(argument)

A] Function parameters:-
-The function parameters are used to take input into the function
at the time calling the function.
-parameters are like local variables
-The default value of parameters is undefined


B] Function arguments:-
-The function argument is a value which is passed to the function
at the time of calling the function.

-The argument can be a value or variable or expression.

// Note: In javascript matching number of and type of parameters and arguments is not mandatory.
// Note: In javascript a function can be assigned to a variable like a value
// A function can be passed as an argument to another function.


## ===========Types of function is javascript=========

1. Named function
2. Anonymous function
3. Arrow function (ES6)

4.callback function
5.higher order function
6.pure function
7.constructor function

## Types of function is javascript
A]. Named function
-If a function is defined with a name then it is called a named function

Example:
function add(a,b){
return a+b;
}

B]. Anonymous function
If a function is defined without name then it is called anonymous
function
Example:

var add = function(a,b){
return a+b;
}


//=============================Hoisting =====================
## Hoisting:-
-Hoisting is a javascript mechanism in which all the function
and variable declarations are moved to top of the current scope.

-Hoisting is a default behaviour of the javascript in which all the function
and variable declarations are moved to top of the current scope.

var nam1; //variable declaration
nam1 = "Topper"; //variable initialization
console.log(nam1); //variable use




## Function Declaration:-
-If the function definition line starts with 'function' keyword then
-it is called function declaration.
Ex:
function add(a,b){
return a+b;
}

-Function declarations are hoisted


C].Function Expression:-
-If the function definition line does not starts with 'function' keyword
then is is called function expression.
Ex:
var add = function(a,b){
return a+b;
}
- Function expressions are not hoisted


D].Self Invoking Function Expression (SIFE)
immediately Invoked Function Expression is javascript function that runs as soon as it is defined
-SIFE is used to limit the scope / to create a new scope

(function () {
console.log("Hello Topper Skills");
})();


E] Default function parameters:- (ES6)

If you assign a value to the function parameter then it is called
default function parameter.
If a parameter does not have matching argument then it uses the default
function parameter.


//============'arguments' object in function:-===================

the arguments object provides the details(arguments, caller, callee)
of a function call.

function add(a, b) {
console.log(arguments);
console.log("Total args: ", arguments.length);
console.log("Callee : ", arguments.callee.name);
console.log("Caller : ", arguments.callee.caller.name);
return a + b;
}
add("a","b")






//================ Fuction return statement:-==============
## Fuction return statement:
-The 'return' statement is used to terminate execution of a function and
returns a value
-A function can return a value.
-If a function is not returning a value then its value will be undefined

//Note: The value which you want to return must be on same line as 'return'
statement is.

You should not write statements after the return statement inside a
function.
function f1() {
return {
name: "Topper Skills",
};
}

function f2() {
return
{
name: "Topper Skills";
}
}


console.log(f1());\\{name: "Topper Skills"}
console.log(f2());\\undefined


//==========================Scope====================

Scope:-
The level of accessibility / availability of variable,function,etc.
in the program is called scope.

In javascript There are 3 scopes
1. Global scope
If you declare a variable inside a module(javascript file) directly
then its scope becomes global.

-A Variable declear outside the function ,scope is called as Global scope.
-A glolbal variable has global scope, all script and function on web can access it.

2. function scope/Local Scope
If you declare a variable inside a function the its scope becomes
function scope/Local Scope
Ex: parameters and loval variables of a function have function scope

3. block scope
If you declare a variable inside a block (if,else,switch,for,etc.)
then its scope becomes block scope.
Note: If you declare a variable using 'var' keyword then the scope of
variable will not be block scope.
For block scoped variable use 'let' or 'const' keyword.

// Imp: For each function call an unique scope gets created and a copy of all
// local variables gets created inside that scope.



//----------------------------------------------
-Multiple variables having same in a same scope is not possible.

-if you declare a varible having same name in the same scope then it will
conflict with the existing variable and existing variable will be repalced
with the latest declared variable.

-By using closure a nested function can access the variables of outer function
with help of lexical scope even after the execution of outer function is
finished

defined after the variable declaration.
But the opposite is not true; the variables defined inside a function will not
be accessible outside that function.

//======================Context=====================

Context:-
context is an object on which the function is called.
context is a current running object inside the function.

'this' keyword:-
this keyword is used to refer the context.
this keyword is used to refer/point the current running object.

//===================================Constructor function====================

-In javascript which is used to intialize the object properties is called constructor function

-The constructor function is used to initialize the object properties
-constructor function name should start with a uppercase letter

The constructor function is useful to create mulitple objects having similar properties

function Student(roll, name, mobile, std) {
this.rollNo = roll;
this.name = name;
this.mobile = mobile;
this.std = std;
}

var s1 = new Student(1, "aaa", "1111", 2)
var s2 = new Student(2, "bbbbb", "22222", 2)
var s3 = new Student(3, "cccccc", "333333", 3)

function printProfile(stud) {
console.log(stud.name);
console.log(stud.rollNo);
console.log(stud.mobile);
console.log(stud.std);
}

printProfile(s1);
printProfile(s2);
printProfile(s3);


//========================== Error ==============================

Error: -

Abnormal condition which stops execution of the software application is called an error

If an error raised then it will terminate the whole application and not a part of the app.


Types of error: -

- Error
- SyntaxError
- TypeError
- ReferenceError
- EvalError
- URIError
- RangeError




//===============================Error Handling====================

Error Handling: -
The errors must be handled to avoid unexpected application ternimation and to show user
friendly error messages.
Following are the main purposes of error handling
- to avoid application crash
- to provide alterative solution
- to display user friendly error messages.



Error Handling: -

To handle the error You need
1. try block
- try block is used to write statements which may raise the errors
- all the statements of try block after the errored statements will not get exeucted even
after error handling.
- try block can be nested
- Do not write all(irrelevant) statements, write related statements inside a try.


2. catch block
- catch block must be after the end of try block, no other statements are allowed between
try and catch.
- try without catch block is allowed but catch without try block is not allowed.
- catch block is used to write alternative solution and display error messages
- without catch block error handling is not possible
- catch block accepts an error object as a parameter.
- In javascript multiple catches are not allowed.


3. finally block

- finally block is optional to use in error handling
- finally block can be used just after the try block of catch block
- finally block will always gets executed despite error raised or not.
- finally block is used to release the resources(db connection, file)


4. throw keyword

- the throw keyword is used to raise and throw an error in call stack.
- the throw keyword is used to raise custom error.

--------------------------

list of statements used in an error handling,

1] try: This statement is used to test a block of code for errors.

2] catch: This statement is used to handle the error

3] throw: This statement is used to create custom errors.

4] finally: This statement is used to execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.

----------------------------
console.log("before statements");

try {
console.log(abc);
} catch (e) {
console.log(e.message);
} finally {
console.log("finally");
}

console.log("after statements");


//=======================Document Object Model==============================

DOM - Document Object Model
DOM is a dynamic representation of a webpage maintained by the web browser.



<!-- -------------window vs document ----------- -->

window is a global object of javascript it is used to load / display a web page
content in the web browser.

The window object represents a tab of a web browser, it includes navigation model, histoy,
location, document, etc.


document represents a web page in the web browser.

document object is a part of window object.

Using document object you can dynamically update the content on the viewport.


//====================DOM tree===========================
DOM tree: -

The web browser reads the web page content and creates a DOM tree in sync with the viewport

The DOM tree has nodes, each node is an object of javascript

There are two types DOM tree nodes
1. DOM element node
The nodes which are created for html elements are called element node

2. DOM text node
The nodes which are created for text and spaces are called text nodes


Accessing DOM nodes: -

There are 6 methods of document to access the DOM node

1. getElementById(id): - returns a node which matches the provided id.

2. getElementsByName(name): - returns a list of nodes which matches the provided name

3. getElementsByTagName(tagname): - returns a list of nodes which matches the provided tagname

4. getElementsByClassName(class): - returns a list of nodes which matches the provided class name

5. querySelector(css selector): - returns a node which matches the provided css selector.

6. querySelectorAll(css selector): - returns a list of nodes which matches the provided css selector


Following are the properties to change the content

- textContent : - This property only work with text data
textContent does not parses the html elements from the string

- innerHTML : - This proprety works with text and html elements
innerHTML parses the the html elements from the string value
innerHTML replaces the child of the element with assigned content

- outerHTML: - This proprety works with text and html elements
outerHTML parses the html elements from the string value
outerHTML replaces the element itself with assigned content




Follwing are the method to manipulate the attributes of an element

setAttribute(aname,avalue); - to add an attribute
hasAttribute(aname); - return true if attribute is avaiable otherwise return false.
removeAttribute(aname); - to remove an attribute



//=============== DOM tree traversa ===============================

- To access parent node
- parentNode: - returns a parent node


- To access child nodes

- firstChild : - returns a first child node including element or text node
- firstElementChild : - returns a first element child node by ignoring text node
- lastChild : - returns a last child node including element or text node
- lastElementChild: - returns a last element child node by ignoring text node
- childNodes: - returns a list of child nodes including text and element nodes
- children: - returns a list of element child nodes by ignoring text node
- childElementCount: - returns total number of child element nodes



- To access Sibling nodes


- nextSibling : - returns a next sibling node including text and element nodes
- nextElementSibling: - returns next element sibling by ignoring text nodes
- previousSibling : - returns previous sibling node including text and element nodes
- previousElementSibling : - returns a previous element sibling node by ignoring text node


//================= Event=================================
Event: -
An action performed at a particular time

There are 2 categories of events
1. Browser event
These are the events performed by the web browser
load
offline
online

2. user event
These are the events performed by the website user.
click
change
mousemove


//==========================Event Handling:===================
Event Handling: -
If you want perform any activity on events then you need to listen to the events.

Ways of listening to events

1. By using event attributes
2. By using event property
3. By using addEventListener() function

addEventListener(eventname, callbackfucntion, propagationphase)
This method is used to listen to any events of a node

eventname: - this should be a valid event name like 'click', 'change', 'mousemove', etc.

callbackfucntion: - it can be any javascript function which will gets executed on the particuler
event of the node.

propagationphase: - to enable capturing phase pass true or to enble bubbling phase pass false
default is false



//===============BOM - Browser Object Model======================

It is not a standard.

Popups
There are 3 popups
1. alert()
It is used to show warning messages to the user

2. confirm()
It is used to take user confirmation


3. prompt()
It is used to take user input



//=====================class ====================================
## class :-

-class is a model of an object.
-By using a class you can create mutliple similar objects.
-In javascript class is a function
-In javascript classes are converted to the constructor functions

Syntax:
class ClassName{
}
// Example:-

class Employee {}

// console.log(typeof Employee);


//=================================Programming Model==========================

Programming Model:-
A Programming model represents a set of features which are used to develop a programming Language.
A programming model is just a specification, it does not comes with any tools.

Following are some of the programming models

1. Object oriented programming model

2. Procedure oriented / structural programming model

3. Functional programming model

etc.




Programming Language:-
A Programming is used to develop the software, it comes rules(syntaxes),
library(built in), tools (compilers)


Example: ChannelSplitterNode,C++, Java, Javascript, etc.



//===================Object Oriented Programming=============

Object Oriented Programming Language?

Characteristics of Object oriented programming

- object
- class

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction

//===================Inheritance================
## Inheritance:-

-Inheritance is a mechanism in which a class acquires the properties of another class
-It is one of the characteristics of OOP
-It is used to reuse the code


The inheritance is achived using extends keyword

Example:-

class A{}
class B extends A{}

A is a super class
B is a subclass


//========Types of inheritance

1. Single
-In Single inheritance there is only one sub class and one super class

Example:

class Animal{}
class Horse extends Animal{}

2. Multilevel

-In Multilevel inheritance one super clase is a sub class is sub class of another super class and so on.
Example:

class A{}

class B extends A{}

class C extends B{}

class N extends C{}


3. Hierarchical

-In heirarchical inheritance one super class is inherited by more than one sub classes

Example:



class A{}

class B extends A{}

class C extends A{}

class D extends A{}



4. Multiple (not suported)
5. Hybrid (not supported)




//================ ===============constructor=======================

// constructor method in a class.

-The constructor of a class is used to initialize the properties of the objects.
-A class can have only one constructor
-In case of inheritance super class constructor must be called from sub class constructor if subclass has
-its own constructor.

class A {
constructor(name, mobile) {
this.name = name;
this.mobile = mobile;
}
}

class B extends A {
city;

constructor(n, m, city) {
super(n, m);
this.city = city;
}
}

const b = new B("Topper Skills", "7875580668", "Pune");

console.log(b);

}


// use the arrow function as method if u want that context of the method always should be
// the same class object
getCity = () => {
console.log(this.city);
};
}



//=====================Polymorphism ======================
Polymorphism :-

Poly = many
morph = forms

Same name and different forms is called polymorphism
There is boy named Ram, age 20

There are 2 ways to achieve the polymorphism.

1. By using method overloading (Javascript does not support method overloading)

In method loading you can define more than one method having same name in a single class

Rules:-

- Methods must be in same class
- Method names must be same
- Method parameters must be different(number or type parameters)
- Method body can be same


Example:-


class Addition{
add(int a,int b){
return a+b;
}

add(int a,float b){
return a+b;
}

}

add(10,20)
add(10,20.3)


Q. Why does Javascript not support method overloading?

In method overloading number of parameters or type of parameters must be different. But
Javascript is dynamic typed language so type parameters cannot defined and matching
number of arguments and parameters at the time of calling function is not mandatory
therefore method overloading is not supported.


Method Overriding:-

If the super class method is not fulfilling the requirement of sub class then sub
defined its own method having same name as super class method this concept is called
method overriding.





























forEach():
- it accepts a function having three parameters (value, index, array)
- It does not return anything
- This function is suitable to perform operatoins on existing array .

Syntax:

forEach(function(value, index, array){

})




//======================================= Operators==============================================================
<pre>
Q5 Operators

JavaScript operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.
JavaScript Arithmetic Operators. ...
JavaScript Assignment Operators. ...
JavaScript String Operators. ...
Comparison Operators. ...
Conditional (Ternary) Operator. ...
Logical Operators. ...
JavaScript Bitwise Operators. ...
The typeof Operator.

1] unary operators: -
    The operators which works on single value are called unary operators
 
// Example:
increment operator(++) - increases the value by one

 //post increment 
var a = 10;
console.log(a++);//10
console.log(a)//11

//pre increment
var b=10
console.log(++b);//11
console.log(b);//11

decrement operators (--) - decreases the value by one 

 //post decrement 
var a = 10;
console.log(a--);//10
console.log(a)//9

//pre decrement
var b=10
console.log(--b);9
console.log(b);0


2] binary operators:-

    - Arithmetic operators
        +, -, *, /,

% (Modulus) - It calculates the remainder  
        12 % 5 = 2
        9 % 5 = 4
        9 % 2 = 1
            
        
        

4] Comparison operators
        == (compare two values without checking the datatypes)
        > greater than 
        >= greater than or equals to 
        < less than 
        <= less than or equals to 
        != not equals to 

        === (compares two values and their datatypes)
        !==  return true if value or data types is not same 

5] Logical Operators
        
        && - AND
        

0   0 = 0
1   0 = 0
0   1 = 0
1   1 = 1
    
    
        
AND operator will check second condition only if the first condition become
        true otherwise it will not check 
    
    
    
    
    || - OR
    
    0   0 = 0
    1   0 = 1
    0   1 = 1
    1   1 = 1
    
    <!-- 10>10 || 20<20 -->

    
OR operator will check the second condition only if first becomes false
    
    

        !
        
6] assignment operators

        =
        +=
        -=
        *=
        /=

7] ternary operators 
condition ? true statement: false statement;

</pre>
//================================================================

Q typeof(): find the datatype of any value/variable you can use typeof operator




-However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible,
-i.e arrow functions can never be used as
constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword.


-arrow functions do not have their own this
-arrow function they dont have own this and equals to this of the outer function.
-this inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to this of the outer function.
If the arrow function has one expression, then the expression is returned implicitly, even without using the return
keyword.


// Arrow function:-
-The arrow function helps to define a function is very less code

Syntax:-

(parameters) => {body}

Define a function to calculate square
// Rules:

If there is only one parameter then writing paranthesis () is optional

If there is single statement/expression in the body then return statement and curly braces are optional

const sq2 = a => a * a;


'this' keyword in Named and anonymous function always refers to the object on which these function are called.

It means it does not matter where the functions are defined but it matters where the functions are called.

'this' in arrow function will always refers to the context (object) under which the function is defined.
It does not matter where the function is called.
