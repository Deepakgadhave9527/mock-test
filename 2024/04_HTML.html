Difference between HTML and HTML5

------------------------HTML5 ------------------------------
-HTML5 language is more mobile-friendly.
-It supports audio and video controls with the use of </audio> and <video> tags.
  -Doctype declaration is quite simple and easy.
  -In HTML5 web storage is used to store the data
  -It support drag and drop effects.
  -with help of HTML5 you can draw shapes like circle, rectangle, triangle etc.
  -html5 intruduce giographical api
  - Vector graphics is additionally an integral a part of HTML5 like SVG and canvas.
  -It is capable of handling inaccurate syntax.

  

  html5 indriduces new element
  <article></article>
  <header></header>
  <footer></footer>
  <aside></aside>
  <figure></figure>
  <figcaption></figcaption>
  <nav></nav>


  -------------------- HTML----------------------------
  -Older version of HTML are less mobile-friendly
  -It didn’t support audio and video without the use of flash player support.
  -Doctype declaration is too long and complicated.
  -it use local storage store data
  -It does not allow drag and drop effects.
  -Not possible to draw shapes like circle, rectangle, triangle etc.
  -It can not handle inaccurate syntax.
  -Vector graphics is possible in HTML with the help of various technologies such as VML, Silver-light, Flash, etc.














  <!-----------------------   Element and Tag ------------------------ -->
  tag
  <p>-> Opening/ starting/ beginning tag

  </p>-> closing / ending tag self closing
  <br />
  <hr />
  <img src="" alt="" />

  element

  <p>content</p>

  attribute attributes are used to pass data to the html element attributes are
  provided in key value pair Ex:
  <a href="#"></a>

  <!-- ------------------------ Differ b & strong Element --------------------------------- -->

  <b></b> -> changes the appearance of the content but does not add importance to
  the content

  <strong></strong> changes the appearance of the content adds importance to the
  content

  <!-- ------------------Differ i & em Element--------------------- -->

  <i></i> - changes the appearance to italic and does not add importance to the
  content

  <em></em> - changes the appearance to the italic and add more importance to the
  content

  <!-- --------------------------- css------------------------------------ -->



  Number of ways to use

  #01 inline css:- If you write the css properties using
  style attribute then it is called inline CSS

  Ex:
  <h1 style="color: aqua">Topper Skills</h1>

  - inline css has highest priority - inline css is not reusable at all 2.

  #02 internal css:- If you write the css properties using style element then it is
  called internal css

  Ex:
  <style>
    /* selector{
        property-name: value
    } */
    h2 {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>

  - internal css has lower priority than inline css and higher priority than
  external css - internal css is reusable only within the same web page 3.
  external css:- If your write css properties in a file with .css extension then
  it is called external css

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="filename.css" />


  #03 external css :--
  - external css has lowest priority - external css is highly reusable - external
  css is recommended to use

  <!-- ----------------------- #1 anchor element =----- -->

  anchor element is used to create the hyperlink
  Hyperlinks connects multiple web pages / web resources

  Anchor element is used to load the web resources

  <a href="#"> Placeholder </a>

  possible values of the href attributes
  - Internal web pages
  - external web pages
  - videos
  - audio
  - pdf
  - .zip
  - phone number
  - email
  - API (whatsapp)
  - section id

  #2 iframe element =

  iframe element provides a window to open/load a web page inside another web page
  <iframe src="table.html" name="myframe">iframe</iframe>




  <!------------------------- #3 AnchorElement:------------------------------ -->



  target attribute is used to decide where(window) to load the resource

  <a href="https://www.maroti.com" target="_parent">Topper Skills</a>


  _self(default):- opens the web page in same window
  _blank :- opens the resource in new window
  _parent:- opens the resource in immediate parent window
  _top :- opens the resource in top window
  iframename :- opens the resource in the iframe matching the name

  The link can be either unvisited, visited, active
  To identify the states of the link each state has a color

  unvisited -> blue
  visited -> purple
  active -> red



  <!-- ------------#4 Picture :- ------------------------- -->
  png (transparent bg, big in size)
  jpg (no transparent bg, low in size after compression)
  gif (animation)
  svg(Scalable Vector Graphics) logos, icons, graphics, reccomended to use
  icon (for small images)

  <!------------------------- block  and inline element ------------------------------------>.



  HTML elements

  block element:
  -block level element start with new row
  - takes full width of their parent elements
  - displays on new line
  - you can set width and height

  Example:
  <div></div>
  <p></p>
  <li></li>
  etc.

  inline element:
  - takes only width required to display their content
  - displays on same line if there is enough space available
  - you can not set width and height

  Example:
  <span></span>
  <a href=""></a>
  <img src="" alt="">
  ect.

  <!--  ----------------  types of list   ---------------------->


  In HTML there are 3 types of list
  1. ordered list
  if you have list some items by maintaining the order/ sequence then use ordered list
  <ol></ol>
  2. unordered list
  if you have list some items without maintaining the order/ sequence then use unordered list
  <ul></ul>
  3. description list
  <dl></dl>
  If you want to list out some items having description of each then use
  description list

  To add items in ordered and unodered list <li></li> is used



  <!------------------------------ form --------------------------->




  value attribute is used to set the state(data) of the form control

  placeholder is used to display sample text in the place of input value

  readonly:- this attribute makes the form input readonly,

  disabled:- this field is not for u

  Are u NRI?
  country:



  <!-- 
types of images 

jpg -> can be compressed, cannot maintain transparency

png -> lossless, provides transparent background

gif -> prefer for animation

ico -> icon in small sizes

svg -> Scallable Vector Graphics 
16px * 16px

1600px * 1600px

 -->


  there are 3 types of list in HTML

  1. ordered list
  - ordered list is used to display items in a particular order with counting
  <ol></ol>

  2. unordered list
  - unordered list is used to display items without following any order and without counting the items
  <ul></ul>

  3. description list
  - description list is used to provide details about each item in the list.
  <dl></dl>


  Semantic element:-
  In html there are some special elements provided to make the source more readable and meaningful such elements are
  called semantic elements.

  Example:
  <header></header>
  <footer></footer>
  <nav></nav>
  <article></article>
  <aside></aside>
  <code></code>
  <section></section>
  <figure></figure>
  <figcaption></figcaption>
  <main></main>
  etc.


  HTML table
  tables are used to display information in tabular form
  tables should not be used to create the web page layout


  <table>
    <thead></thead>
    <tbody></tbody>
    <tfoot></tfoot>
  </table>

  <tr></tr>

  <th></th>

  <td></td>

  iframe element provides a window to open/load a web page inside another web page

  ## Padding:-
  padding is the transparent space between border and content area of the element
  e.g
  padding: top right bottom left;
  padding: top right/left bottom;
  padding: top/bottom right/left

  ## Margin
  padding is the transparent space between border and content area of the element

  margin is transparent space outside the element

  margin-side: value

  margin: top right bottom left;
  margin: top right/left bottom;
  margin: top/bottom right/left;
  margin: allsides;

  <!-----------------           Transition         ---------------------->

  The transition property is a shorthand property for:

  transition-property
  transition-duration
  transition-timing-function
  transition-delay



  <!--------------------------- selector -------------------------- -->


  The CSS selectors are used to select one or more html elements to style
  There are different categories of CSS selectors
  - General selectors
  - Attribute selectors
  - Pseudo selectors
  1. Pseudo element selectors
  2. Pseudo class selectors



  element selector:- selects all the elements of provided tagname

  /* p {
  color: red;
  } */

  id selector:- selects all the elements having provided id
  id selector should start with #
  Id selector is preferred to style specific element
  id selector has more priority than class selector


  class selector:- selects all the elements having provided class name

  class selector should start with .

  class selector is used to write reusable css
  class selector has lower priority than id selector


  <!-------------------------- Combinators ---------------------- -->

  A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.

  There are four different combinators in CSS:

  descendant selector (space)
  child selector (>)
  adjacent sibling selector (+)
  general sibling selector (~)

  1-->Descendant Selector
  / select all the span elements which are child of div /
  / space combinator select all the child elements of div which matches the right hand side selector /
  The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.


  2-->Child Selector (>)
  > combinator is used to select direct child element

  The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.

  3-->Adjacent Sibling Selector (+)
  + select next immediate sibling
  The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.
  Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".


  4-->General Sibling Selector (~)
  ~ selects all the next siblings which matches the right hand side selector

  The general sibling selector selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element.


  <!-- ------------- Attribute Selector ----------------------->

  /* syntax:

  element[attribute]{}
  element[attribute=value]{}

  select all the elements having href attribute
  a[href] {
  color: red;
  }

  select all the element which do not have href attribute

  a:not([href]) {
  color: blue;
  }

  h1[title] {
  color: green;
  Selecting element based on attribute value

  = exact match
  ^= match the starting part of the attribute value-->starting value
  $= match the provided value with the end of attribute value-->Ending value
  *= match the sub string in attribute value--- anyValue
  ~= match the words in attribute value */--> fullspecific word
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  ##01

  select all the links of "https://www.topperskills.com"

  CSS [attribute="value"] Selector
  The [attribute="value"] selector is used to select elements with a specified attribute and value.


  a[href="https://www.topperskills.com"] {
  color: red;
  }

  -------------------------------------------------------------
  ##02

  CSS [attribute^="value"] Selector
  select all the secure links starting with value

  The [attribute^="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value begins with a specified value.


  a[href ^="https"] {
  color: green;
  }


  ------------------------------------------------------------
  ##03
  CSS [attribute$="value"] Selector
  The [attribute$="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value ends with a specified value.
  / select all the element whose href attribute value ends with .in /

  a[href $=".in"] {
  color: orange;
  }

  --------------------------------------------------------------
  ##04
  CSS [attribute*="value"] Selector
  The [attribute*="value"] selector is used to select elements whose attribute value contains a specified value.
  / select all elements having topperskills in their href attribute /

  a[href *="topperskills"] {
  color: cyan;
  }


  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ##05
  CSS [attribute~="value"] Selector
  The [attribute~="value"] selector is used to select elements with an attribute value containing a specified word.
  / select all the elements which have "reactjs" in their title /

  h1[title~="reactjs"] {
  color: brown;
  }


  <!-------------------    Pseudo Selectors  ---------------------------------->



  Pseudo Selectors
  1. Pseudo Element Selector ::
  It is used to select part of the element
  --selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s).

  2. Pseudo Class Selector :
  It is used to select elements based on their state and position
  A Pseudo class in CSS is used to define the special state of an element.
  It can be combined with a CSS selector to add
  an effect to existing elements based on their states.

  <!---------------------------------- Postion --------------------------------- -->


  position property is used to set the position of any element
  By default all the elements are positioned to left to right

  default position is called static, you cannot use top, right, bottom, left

  The position property has differnt values like
  static (default)
  relative
  absolute
  fixed
  sticky


  ##01 relative:-
  - measurement of the length (top, right, bottom, left) starts from
  its default/static position
  - It will hold the space


  ##02 Absolute:-
  - measurement of the length(top, right, bottom, left) starts
  from relative positioned parent, but if there is no relative
  parent then measurement will start from body
  - It will not hold the initial space.

  ##03 fixed:-
  - measurement starts from body
  - it does not hold the space
  - it does not move on scroll


  ##04 sticky:-
  - measurement starts from body
  - it holds the space
  - it moves only within the viewport

  ##05 static:-
  Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
  it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:




  <!-------------------------------------- Animation------------------------------- -->

  To create an animation you need to create multiple styles (frames) and
  display those frames at a specific speed

  To create/ define frames there is rule in css @keyframes
  What are CSS Animations?
  An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.

  You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.

  To use CSS animation, you must first specify some keyframes for the animation.

  Keyframes hold what styles the element will have at certain times.

  The @keyframes Rule
  When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule, the animation will gradually change from the current style
  to
  the new style at certain times.

  ## Animation Properties

  @keyframes
  animation-name
  animation-duration
  animation-delay
  animation-iteration-count
  animation-direction
  animation-timing-function
  animation-fill-mode
  animation



  ##01 animation-duration
  The animation-duration property defines how long time an animation should take to complete.
  using the keywords "from" and "to" (which represents 0% (start) and 100% (complete)).

  ##02 animation-delay
  The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation.

  ##03 animation-iteration-count
  The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should run.

  ##04 animation-direction
  The animation-direction property specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate
  cycles.

  The animation-direction property
  normal
  reverse
  alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards
  alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards

  ##05 animation-timing-function
  The animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation.
  ease
  linear
  ease-in
  ease-out
  ease-in-out
  cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a

  ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
  linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
  ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start
  ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end
  ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end
  cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a


  animation shortHand properties
  animation-name: example;
  animation-duration: 5s;
  animation-timing-function: linear;
  animation-delay: 2s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-direction: alternate;


  <!---------------------------- Transfrom ------------------------------------------ -->
  The transform property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale,
  move,
  skew, etc., elements.

  ## 01 transform-origin
  The transform-origin CSS property sets the origin for an element's transformations.
  The transform-origin property allows you to change the position of transformed elements.

  <!-- ----------------------------------2D transform ----------------------------------- ------------------------>


  CSS 2D Transforms Methods
  With the CSS transform property you can use the following 2D transformation methods:

  translate()
  rotate()
  scaleX()
  scaleY()
  scale()
  skewX()
  skewY()
  skew()
  matrix()


  <!-- Matrix transformation -->
  matrix()
  Describes a homogeneous 2D transformation matrix.

  matrix3d()
  Describes a 3D transformation as a 4×4 homogeneous matrix.
  <!-- Perspective -->
  perspective()
  Sets the distance between the user and the z=0 plane.
  <!-- Rotation -->
  rotate()
  Rotates an element around a fixed point on the 2D plane.

  rotate3d()
  Rotates an element around a fixed axis in 3D space.

  rotateX()
  Rotates an element around the horizontal axis.

  rotateY()
  Rotates an element around the vertical axis.

  rotateZ()
  Rotates an element around the z-axis.
  <!-- Scaling (resizing) -->
  scale()
  Scales an element up or down on the 2D plane.

  scale3d()
  Scales an element up or down in 3D space.

  scaleX()
  Scales an element up or down horizontally.

  scaleY()
  Scales an element up or down vertically.

  scaleZ()
  Scales an element up or down along the z-axis.
  <!-- Skewing (distortion) -->
  skew()
  Skews an element on the 2D plane.

  skewX()
  Skews an element in the horizontal direction.

  skewY()
  Skews an element in the vertical direction.
  <!-- Translation (moving) -->
  translate()
  Translates an element on the 2D plane.

  translate3d()
  Translates an element in 3D space.

  translateX()
  Translates an element horizontally.

  translateY()
  Translates an element vertically.

  translateZ()
  Translates an element along the z-axis.



  ##01 The translate() Method
  The translate() method moves an element from its current position (according to the parameters given for the X-axis
  and
  the Y-axis).
  The translate() CSS function repositions an element in the horizontal and/or vertical directions. Its result is a
  <transform-function> data type.


    ##02
    The rotate() Method

    The rotate() method rotates an element clockwise or counter-clockwise according to a given degree.

    Using negative values will rotate the element counter-clockwise.
    Using postive values will rotate the element clockwise.


    ##03 scale()

    A CSS scale() function is defined as a CSS Transformation property which allows resizing an element in the
    Two-dimensional Plane. It is used to increase or decrease the size of an element.
    The scale() method increases or decreases the size of an element (according to the parameters given for the width
    and
    height).

    Transform: scale(0); Scaled out of the plane and not visible.
    Transform: scale(3,1); Horizontal size is scaled up by three and the vertical is unchanged

    {it is negative, the result a point reflection in that dimension}.

    ##4 scaleX()
    The scaleX() CSS function defines a transformation that resizes an element along the x-axis -->horizontally

    ##5 scaleY()
    The scaleY() CSS function defines a transformation that resizes an element along the y-axis -->Vertically


    ##06 skewX()
    The skewX() method skews an element along the X-axis by the given angle.-->horizontally

    ##07 skewY()
    The skewY() method skews an element along the Y-axis by the given angle.-->Vertically

    ##08 skew()
    The skew() method skews an element along the X and Y-axis by the given angles.

    ##09 The rotateX() Method
    The rotateX() method rotates an element around its X-axis at a given degree:
    rotate around horizontally

    ##10 The rotateY() Method
    The rotateY() method rotates an element around its Y-axis at a given degree:
    rotate around vertically

    ##11 The rotateZ() Method
    The rotateZ() method rotates an element around its Z-axis at a given degree:
    rotate around cricle



    <!-------- ----------------------------  Responsive design vs Adaptive design -------------------------------  -->
    Responsive design vs Adaptive design


    Adaptive design:-
    - You need to create a separate web page for each targeted device.
    - content duplication
    - - requires more man power
    - device detection happens at server side.
    - easy to design
    - suitable for big and complex web pages

    Example:

    https://www.facebook.com -> desktop version
    https://m.facebook.com -> mobile version


    Responsive Design:-
    If a web page changes its layout according to the device(screen size) is called
    responsive web page design

    - you need to write styles for all targeted devices
    - no content duplication
    - requires less manpower
    - device detection happens in the web browser
    - hard to design
    - suitable for small and less complex designs


    Example:
    https://www.topperskills.com/mean



    <!---------------------------------------------- Media Query --------------------------------------------------------->
    Media queries are used to identify the targeted devices based of their features like width,height, orientation,
    etc. -
    using
    media query you can apply specific style for specific Types of Media :- - screen - speech - print - all

    Syntax:-


    @media [mediatype], (max-width: 500px){


    }

    Media queries can modify the appearance (and even behavior) or a website or app based on a matched set of
    conditions
    about the user’s device, browser or system settings.

    Media queries allow you to customize the presentation of your web pages for a specific range of devices like
    mobile
    phones, tablets, desktops, etc. without any change in markups

    /* Extra small devices (phones, 600px and down) */
    @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {...}

    /* Small devices (portrait tablets and large phones, 600px and up) */
    @media only screen and (min-width: 600px) {...}

    /* Medium devices (landscape tablets, 768px and up) */
    @media only screen and (min-width: 768px) {...}

    /* Large devices (laptops/desktops, 992px and up) */
    @media only screen and (min-width: 992px) {...}

    /* Extra large devices (large laptops and desktops, 1200px and up) */
    @media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) {...}


    The @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices.

    Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

    width and height of the viewport
    width and height of the device
    orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)

    @media not|only mediatype and (expressions) {
    CSS-Code;
    }

    <!-- 
mobile (extra small device) xs ->   size  <= 575.98px  
tablet (small device) sm ->     size >= 576px  &&  size <= 767.98px 
laptop (medium device) md ->    size >= 768px  &&  size <= 991.98px
desktop (large device) lg       size >= 991.98px  && size <= 1199.98px
big screen (extra large device) xl -> size >= 1200px  -->


    media types:--
    all (suitable for all devices)
    braille
    embossed
    handheld
    print
    projection
    screen
    speech
    tty
    TV




    <!----------------------------------------length units ---------------------------------------------------  -->


    There are 2 types of length units
    1. absolute length units
    absolute length units are not relative to anything else means
    the length remains same in all cases
    Example:-
    px , pt, in, cm, etc;

    2. relative length units
    The relative length units are relative to something else like
    parent font, viewport width, viewport height, etc.
    Example:
    em (element) - it is relative to font size of parent element

    1em = font size of parent element
    Ex: parent font-size = 16px;
    1em = 16px
    2em = 32px
    .5em = 8px
    1.5em = 24px



    rem (root element) - it is relative to font size of root element (html)
    1rem = font size of root element
    Ex: root element font-size = 16px;
    1rem = 16px
    2rem = 32px
    .5rem = 8px
    1.5rem = 24px


    vh -> Viewport height 100vh = total height of viewport
    vw -> Viewport width 100vw = total width of viewport


    viewport is the area on the web browser when the web page gets displyed.





    <!------------------------------------------------------------- Flex --------------------------------------------------------------------->


    The flex container properties are:

    flex-direction
    flex-wrap
    flex-flow
    justify-content
    align-items
    align-content



    ##01 flex-direction
    The flex-direction property defines in which direction the container wants to stack the flex items.

    The flex-direction property accepts 4 different values:

    row (default): same as text direction
    row-reverse: opposite to text direction
    column: same as row but top to bottom
    column-reverse: same as row-reverse top to bottom


    ##02 flex-wrap
    The flex-wrap Property
    The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not.

    It defines whether the flex items are forced in a single line or can be flowed into multiple lines. If set to
    multiple
    lines, it also defines the cross-axis which determines the direction new lines are stacked in.

    The flex-wrap property accepts 3 different values:

    nowrap (default): single-line which may cause the container to overflow
    wrap: multi-lines, direction is defined by flex-direction
    wrap-reverse: multi-lines, opposite to direction defined by flex-direction

    ##03 flex-flow
    The flex-flow property is a shorthand property for setting both the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties.

    ##04 justify-content
    The justify-content property is used to align the flex items:

    The justify-content property accepts five different values:
    flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start line
    flex-end: items are packed toward to end line
    center: items are centered along the line
    space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end
    line
    space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them
    space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two adjacent alignment subjects, before the
    first
    alignment subject, and after the last alignment subject is the same


    ##05 align-items


    The align-items property accepts 5 different values:

    flex-start: cross-start margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-start line
    flex-end: cross-end margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-end line
    center: items are centered in the cross-axis
    baseline: items are aligned such as their baselines align
    stretch (default): stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)

    ##06 align-content
    The align-content property is used to align the flex lines.
    The CSS align-content property sets the distribution of space between and around content items
    along a flexbox's
    cross-axis or a grid's block axis.
    The align-content property accepts 6 different values:

    flex-start: lines packed to the start of the container
    flex-end: lines packed to the end of the container
    center: lines packed to the center of the container
    space-between: lines evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at
    the
    end
    space-around: lines evenly distributed with equal space between them
    stretch (default): lines stretch to take up the remaining space
